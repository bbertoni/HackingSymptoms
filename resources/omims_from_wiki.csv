610006,2-methylbutyrylglycinuria,"SBCADD is included as a secondary target condition in most newborn screening programs, as the key analyte is the same as is used to identify isovaleric acidemia.   Most cases have been Hmong individuals, who are asymptomatic.  There are isolated case reports where individuals have been identified with SBCADD in addition to developmental delay and epilepsy.  It is currently unclear what the complete clinical presentation of SBCADD looks like.  There is some concern that these cases with additional symptoms may reflect an ascertainment bias rather than being a true representation of the clinical spectrum of the disease.  Currently, there is no accepted treatment, as most affected individuals do not require any.  Some recommend avoidance of valproic acid, as it can be a substrate for 2-methylbutyryl-CoA dehydrogenase.","['HP:0000252', 'HP:0000577', 'HP:0001250', 'HP:0001252', 'HP:0001254', 'HP:0001263', 'HP:0001270', 'HP:0001290', 'HP:0001943', 'HP:0002045', 'HP:0003700', 'HP:0005949']"
231530,3-hydroxyacyl-coa dehydrogenase deficiency,"Typically, initial signs and symptoms of this disorder occur during infancy or early childhood and can include poor appetite, vomiting, diarrhea, lethargy, hypoglycemia, hypotonia, liver problems, and hyperinsulinism (high levels of insulin). Insulin controls the amount of sugar that moves from the blood into cells for conversion to energy. Individuals with 3-hydroxyacyl-coenzyme A dehydrogenase deficiency are also at risk for complications such as seizures, life-threatening heart and breathing problems, coma, and sudden unexpected death.
Problems related to 3-hydroxyacyl-coenzyme A dehydrogenase deficiency can be triggered by periods of fasting or by illnesses such as viral infections. This disorder is sometimes mistaken for Reye syndrome, a severe disorder that may develop in children while they appear to be recovering from viral infections such as chicken pox or flu. Most cases of Reye syndrome are associated with the use of aspirin during these viral infections.",[]

305400,Aarskog–Scott syndrome,"People with Aarskog–Scott syndrome often have distinctive facial features, such as widely spaced eyes (hypertelorism), a small nose, a long area between the nose and mouth (philtrum), and a widow's peak hairline. They frequently have mild to moderate short stature during childhood, but their growth usually catches up with that of their peers during puberty. Hand abnormalities are common in this syndrome and include short fingers (brachydactyly), curved pinky fingers (fifth finger clinodactyly), webbing of the skin between some fingers (cutaneous syndactyly), and a single crease across the palm. Other abnormalities in people with Aarskog–Scott syndrome include heart defects and a split in the upper lip (cleft lip) with or without an opening in the roof of the mouth (cleft palate).Most males with Aarskog–Scott syndrome have a shawl scrotum, in which the scrotum surrounds the penis instead of hanging below. Less often, they have undescended testes (cryptorchidism) or a soft out-pouching around the belly-button (umbilical hernia) or in the lower abdomen (inguinal hernia).The intellectual development of people with Aarskog–Scott syndrome varies widely. Some may have mild learning and behavior problems, while others have normal intelligence. In rare cases, severe intellectual disability has been reported.","['HP:0000023', 'HP:0000028', 'HP:0000049', 'HP:0000144', 'HP:0000164', 'HP:0000175', 'HP:0000202', 'HP:0000204', 'HP:0000232', 'HP:0000286', 'HP:0000289', 'HP:0000311', 'HP:0000316', 'HP:0000327', 'HP:0000337', 'HP:0000343', 'HP:0000349', 'HP:0000368', 'HP:0000431', 'HP:0000463', 'HP:0000470', 'HP:0000485', 'HP:0000486', 'HP:0000494', 'HP:0000508', 'HP:0000540', 'HP:0000668', 'HP:0000684', 'HP:0000708', 'HP:0000767', 'HP:0000823', 'HP:0000954', 'HP:0000974', 'HP:0001156', 'HP:0001159', 'HP:0001169', 'HP:0001187', 'HP:0001256', 'HP:0001263', 'HP:0001508', 'HP:0001537', 'HP:0001544', 'HP:0001635', 'HP:0001762', 'HP:0001763', 'HP:0001769', 'HP:0001773', 'HP:0001883', 'HP:0002055', 'HP:0002650', 'HP:0002816', 'HP:0003196', 'HP:0003311', 'HP:0003318', 'HP:0003319', 'HP:0003502', 'HP:0004209', 'HP:0004279', 'HP:0004322', 'HP:0005640', 'HP:0005692', 'HP:0006101', 'HP:0007018', 'HP:0008572', 'HP:0009237', 'HP:0009466', 'HP:0009748', 'HP:0009890', 'HP:0012774', 'HP:0030084', 'HP:0030680', 'HP:0032277', 'HP:0100490', 'HP:0100543', 'HP:0200055']"

200990,Acrocallosal syndrome,"Acrocallosal syndrome (ACLS, ACS, Schinzel-Type, Hallux-duplication) is a rare, heterogeneous autosomal recessive disorder first discovered by Albert Schinzel (1979) in a 3-year-old boy. To inherit ACLS, one gene copy from each parent must contain a mutation somewhere in the KIF7 gene and be passed on to the child . Characteristics of this syndrome include absence or poor development of the area connecting the left and right parts of the brain, an abnormally large head, increased distance between facial features (eyes), poor motor skills, mental retardation, extra fingers and toes, many facial deformities, and cleft palate .

Infants who are exclusively breast-fed may present in this manner shortly after birth, due to poor feeding.  In some individuals the first manifestation of MCADD may be sudden death following a minor illness.  A number of individuals with MCADD may remain completely asymptomatic, provided they never encounter a situation that sufficiently stresses their metabolism.  With the advent of expanded newborn screening, some mothers have been identified with MCADD after their infants had positive newborn screens for low carnitine levels.The enzyme MCAD is responsible for the dehydrogenation step of fatty acids with chain lengths between 6 and 12 carbons as they undergo beta-oxidation in the mitochondria.  Fatty acid beta-oxidation provides energy after the body has used up its stores of glucose and glycogen.  This oxidation typically occurs during periods of extended fasting or illness when caloric intake is reduced, and energy needs are increased.","['HP:0000256', 'HP:0000750', 'HP:0001250', 'HP:0001251', 'HP:0001252', 'HP:0001254', 'HP:0001259', 'HP:0001263', 'HP:0001290', 'HP:0001315', 'HP:0001397', 'HP:0001410', 'HP:0001640', 'HP:0001942', 'HP:0001943', 'HP:0001946', 'HP:0001987', 'HP:0002013', 'HP:0002014', 'HP:0002069', 'HP:0002181', 'HP:0002240', 'HP:0002373', 'HP:0002875', 'HP:0002910', 'HP:0003108', 'HP:0003198', 'HP:0003202', 'HP:0003215', 'HP:0003234', 'HP:0003236', 'HP:0003394', 'HP:0003473', 'HP:0003701', 'HP:0003738', 'HP:0004326', 'HP:0005684', 'HP:0007185', 'HP:0008309', 'HP:0011675', 'HP:0011936', 'HP:0012378', 'HP:0030199', 'HP:0040155', 'HP:0045040']"

Nonfunctional tumors (about 40%, authorities vary) usually present with abdominal or flank pain, varicocele, and renal vein thrombosis or they may be asymptomatic and detected incidentally.All patients with suspected ACC should be carefully evaluated for signs and symptoms of hormonal syndromes. For Cushing's syndrome (glucocorticoid excess), these include weight gain, muscle wasting, purple lines on the abdomen, a fatty ""buffalo hump"" on the neck, a ""moon-like"" face, and thinning, fragile skin. Virilism (androgen excess) is most obvious in women, and may produce excess facial and body hair, acne, enlargement of the clitoris, deepening of the voice, coarsening of facial features, cessation of menstruation. Conn syndrome (mineralcorticoid excess) is marked by high blood pressure, which can result in headache and hypokalemia (low serum potassium, which can in turn produce muscle weakness, confusion, and palpitations), low plasma renin activity, and high serum aldosterone.

The other two disorders are neonatal adrenoleukodystrophy (NALD), and infantile Refsum disease (IRD). Although all have a similar molecular basis for disease, Zellweger syndrome is the most severe of these three disorders.Zellweger syndrome is associated with impaired neuronal migration, neuronal positioning, and brain development. In addition, individuals with Zellweger syndrome can show a reduction in central nervous system (CNS) myelin (particularly cerebral), which is referred to as hypomyelination. Myelin is critical for normal CNS functions, and in this regard, serves to insulate nerve fibers in the brain. Patients can also show postdevelopmental sensorineuronal degeneration that leads to a progressive loss of hearing and vision.Zellweger syndrome can also affect the function of many other organ systems. Patients can show craniofacial abnormalities (such as a high forehead, hypoplastic supraorbital ridges, epicanthal folds, midface hypoplasia, and a large fontanel), hepatomegaly (enlarged liver), chondrodysplasia punctata (punctate calcification of the cartilage in specific regions of the body), eye abnormalities, and renal cysts.

225750,"Aicardi–Goutières syndrome 1, dominant and recessive","The initial description of AGS suggested that the disease was always severe, and was associated with unremitting neurological decline, resulting in death in childhood. As more cases have been identified, it has become apparent that this is not necessarily the case, with many patients now considered to demonstrate an apparently stable clinical picture, alive in their 4th decade. Moreover, rare individuals with pathogenic mutations in the AGS-related genes can be minimally affected (perhaps only with chilblains) and are in mainstream education, and even affected siblings within a family can show marked differences in severity.In about ten percent of cases, AGS presents at or soon after birth (i.e. in the neonatal period).  This presentation of the disease is characterized by microcephaly, neonatal seizures, poor feeding, jitteriness, cerebral calcifications (accumulation of calcium deposits in the brain), white matter abnormalities, and cerebral atrophy; thus indicating that the disease process became active before birth i.e. in utero. These infants can have hepatosplenomegaly and thrombocytopaenia, very much like cases of transplacental viral infection. About one third of such early presenting cases, most frequently in association with mutations in TREX1, die in early childhood.
Otherwise the majority of AGS cases present in early infancy, sometimes after an apparently normal period of development. During the first few months after birth, these children develop features of an encephalopathy with irritability, persistent crying, feeding difficulties, an intermittent fever (without obvious infection), and abnormal neurology with disturbed tone, dystonia, an exaggerated startle response, and sometimes seizures.Glaucoma can be present at birth, or develop later.

The pain can be severe to the point that interferes with activities of daily living and may affect ability to work. Joint-replacement surgery (hip and shoulder) is often necessary at a relatively young age. In the longer term, the involvement of the spinal joints leads to reduced movement of the rib cage and can affect breathing. Bone mineral density may be affected, increasing the risk of bone fractures, and rupture of tendons and muscles may occur.Valvular heart disease, mainly calcification and regurgitation of the aortic and mitral valves, may occur, and in severe and progressive cases, valve replacement may be necessary. Irregularities in the heart rhythm and heart failure affect a significant proportion of people with alkaptonuria (40% and 10%, respectively). Hearing loss affects 40% of people.

203700,Alpers syndrome,"All forms of MDDS are very rare.  MDDS causes a wide range of symptoms, which can appear in newborns, infants, children, or adults, depending on the class of MDDS; within each class symptoms are also diverse.In MDDS associated with mutations in TK2, infants generally develop normally, but by around two years of age, symptoms of general muscle weakness (called ""hypotonia""), tiredness, lack of stamina, and difficulty feeding begin to appear.  Some toddlers start to lose control of the muscles in their face, mouth, and throat, and may have difficulty swallowing.  Motor skills that had been learned may be lost, but generally the functioning of the brain and ability to think are not affected.In MDDS associated with mutations in SUCLA2 or SUCLG1 that primarily affect the brain and muscle, hypotonia generally arises in infants before they are 6 months old, their muscles begin wasting away, and there is delay in psychomotor learning (learning basic skills like walking, talking, and intentional, coordinated movement).  The spine often begins to curve (scoliosis or kyphosis), and the child often has abnormal movements (dystonia, athetosis or chorea), difficulty feeding, acid reflux, hearing loss, stunted growth, and difficulty breathing that can lead to frequent lung infections.  Sometime epilepsy develops.In MDDS associated with mutations in RRM2B that primarily affect the brain and muscle, there is again hypotonia in the first months, symptoms of lactic acidosis like nausea, vomiting, and rapid deep breathing, failure to thrive including the head remaining small, delay or regression in moving, and hearing loss.  Many body systems are affected. The Charlie Gard case was associated with this sub form of the disease.
In MDDS associated with mutations in DGUOK that primarily affect the brain and the liver, there are two forms.   There is an early-onset form in which symptoms arise from problems in many organs in the first week of life, especially symptoms of lactic acidosis as well as low blood sugar.  Within weeks of birth they can develop liver failure and the associated jaundice and abdominal swelling, and many neurological problems including developmental delays and regression, and uncontrolled eye movement.  Rarely within this class of already rare diseases, symptoms only relating to liver disease emerge later in infancy or in childhood.In MDDS associated with mutations in MPV17 that primarily affect the brain and the liver, the symptoms are similar to those caused by DGUOK and also emerge shortly after birth, generally with fewer and less severe neurological problems.  There is a subset of people of Navajo descent who develop Navajo neurohepatopathy, who in addition to these symptoms also have easily broken bones that do not cause pain, deformed hands or feet, and problems with their corneas.In MDDS associated with mutations in POLG that primarily affect the brain and the liver, the symptoms are very diverse and can emerge anytime from shortly after birth to old age. The  first signs of the disease, which include intractable seizures and failure to meet meaningful developmental milestones, usually occur in infancy, after the first year of life, but sometimes as late as the fifth year. Primary symptoms of the disease are developmental delay, progressive intellectual disability, hypotonia (low muscle tone), spasticity (stiffness of the limbs) possibly leading to quadriplegia, and progressive dementia. Seizures may include epilepsia partialis continua, a type of seizure that consists of repeated myoclonic (muscle) jerks. Optic atrophy may also occur, often leading to blindness. Hearing loss may also occur. Additionally, although physical signs of chronic liver dysfunction may not be present, many people suffer liver impairment leading to liver failure.In MDDS associated with mutations in PEO1/C10orf2 that primarily affect the brain and the liver, symptoms emerge shortly after birth or in early infancy, with hypotonia, symptoms of lactic acidosis, enlarged liver, feeding problems, lack of growth, and delay of psychomotor skills.  Neurologically, development is slowed or stopped, and epilepsy emerges, as do sensory problems like loss of eye control and deafness, and neuromuscular problems like a lack of reflexes, muscular atrophy, and twitching, and epilepsy.In MDDS associated with mutations in the genes associated with mutations in ECGF1/TYMP  that primarily affects the brain and the gastrointestinal tract, symptoms can emerge any time in the first fifty years of life; most often they emerge before the person turns 20.   Weight loss is common as is a lack of the ability of the stomach and intestines to automatically expand and contract and thus move through it (called gastrointestinal motility) – this leads to feeling full after eating only small amounts of food, nausea, acid reflux,  All affected individuals develop weight loss and progressive gastrointestinal dysmotility manifesting as early satiety, nausea, diarrhea, vomiting, and stomach pain and swelling.  People also develop neuropathy, with weakness and tingling.  There are often eye problems, and intellectual disability.","['HP:0000252', 'HP:0000315', 'HP:0000478', 'HP:0000504', 'HP:0000572', 'HP:0000618', 'HP:0000649', 'HP:0000726', 'HP:0001251', 'HP:0001252', 'HP:0001257', 'HP:0001259', 'HP:0001263', 'HP:0001266', 'HP:0001272', 'HP:0001276', 'HP:0001284', 'HP:0001290', 'HP:0001336', 'HP:0001399', 'HP:0001408', 'HP:0001413', 'HP:0001414', 'HP:0001508', 'HP:0002013', 'HP:0002069', 'HP:0002133', 'HP:0002151', 'HP:0002171', 'HP:0002191', 'HP:0002240', 'HP:0002313', 'HP:0002376', 'HP:0002385', 'HP:0002446', 'HP:0002529', 'HP:0002910', 'HP:0002922', 'HP:0003219', 'HP:0003287', 'HP:0003470', 'HP:0003535', 'HP:0006964', 'HP:0007359', 'HP:0012072', 'HP:0012847', 'HP:0100022', 'HP:0100704']"

These attacks are often triggered by an infection, fasting (not eating), or in some cases, other types of stress.","['HP:0000713', 'HP:0000741', 'HP:0000822', 'HP:0000969', 'HP:0000980', 'HP:0001249', 'HP:0001250', 'HP:0001251', 'HP:0001252', 'HP:0001256', 'HP:0001257', 'HP:0001259', 'HP:0001262', 'HP:0001265', 'HP:0001270', 'HP:0001824', 'HP:0001894', 'HP:0001941', 'HP:0001942', 'HP:0001943', 'HP:0001944', 'HP:0001945', 'HP:0001974', 'HP:0001987', 'HP:0001993', 'HP:0002013', 'HP:0002014', 'HP:0002039', 'HP:0002149', 'HP:0002151', 'HP:0002240', 'HP:0002615', 'HP:0002789', 'HP:0002919', 'HP:0003074', 'HP:0004372', 'HP:0005974', 'HP:0007308', 'HP:0010864', 'HP:0011446', 'HP:0012523', 'HP:0012705', 'HP:0012735', 'HP:0500001']"

Light sensitivity and vision problems (cone-rod dystrophy) in all cases, usually within 15 months of birth and progressively worsening until about 20 years of age
Delays in early, developmental milestones in 50% of cases, learning disabilities in about 30% of cases
Obesity in 100% of cases, apparent by 5 years of age but often apparent in infancy (Alström infants usually have normal birth weights, and by adolescence, weights tend to be in the high-normal to normal range.)
Nystagmus (usually affects the children), one of the first symptoms to occur which causes involuntary rapid eye movement.
Mild to moderate bilateral sensorineural hearing loss.
Type 2 diabetes usually occurs in early childhood.
Hyperinsulinemia/insulin resistance—development of high level of insulin in blood.
Hypertriglyceridemia
Steatosis (fatty liver) and elevated transaminases (liver enzymes) often develop in childhood and can progress in some patients to cirrhosis and liver failure.
Endocrine dysfunctions may occur where the patient may experience an under or over active thyroid gland, weak growth hormone, increased androgen in females and low testosterone in males.

139300,Aromatase excess syndrome,"Observed physiological abnormalities of the condition include a dramatic overexpression of aromatase and, accordingly, excessive levels of estrogens including estrone and estradiol and a very high rate of peripheral conversion of androgens to estrogens. In one study, cellular aromatase mRNA expression was found to be at least 10 times higher in a female patient compared to the control, and the estradiol/testosterone ratio after an injection of testosterone in a male patient was found to be 100 times greater than the control. Additionally, in another study, androstenedione, testosterone, and dihydrotestosterone (DHT) were found to be either low or normal in males, and follicle-stimulating hormone (FSH) levels were very low (likely due to suppression by estrogen, which has antigonadotropic effects as a form of negative feedback inhibition on sex steroid production in sufficiently high amounts), whereas luteinizing hormone (LH) levels were normal.According to a recent review, estrone levels have been elevated in 17 of 18 patients (94%), while estradiol levels have been elevated only in 13 of 27 patients (48%). As such, estrone is the main estrogen elevated in the condition. In more than half of patients, circulating androstenedione and testosterone levels are low to subnormal. The ratio of circulating estradiol to testosterone is >10 in 75% of cases. FSH levels are said to be consistently low in the condition, while LH levels are in the low to normal range.It is notable that gynecomastia has been observed in patients in whom estradiol levels are within the normal range. This has been suggested to be due to in situ conversion of adrenal androgens into estrone and then estradiol (via local 17β-HSD) in breast tissue (where aromatase activity may be particularly high).
The symptoms of AEXS, in males, include heterosexual precocity (precocious puberty with phenotypically-inappropriate secondary sexual characteristics; i.e., a fully or mostly feminized appearance), severe prepubertal or peripubertal gynecomastia (development of breasts in males before or around puberty), high-pitched voice, sparse facial hair, hypogonadism (dysfunctional gonads), oligozoospermia (low sperm count), small testes, micropenis (an unusually small penis), advanced bone maturation, an earlier peak height velocity (an accelerated rate of growth in regards to height), and short final stature due to early epiphyseal closure. The incidence of gynecomastia appears to be 100%, with 20 of 30 male cases opting for mastectomy according to a review.In females, symptoms of AEXS include isosexual precocity (precocious puberty with phenotypically-appropriate secondary sexual characteristics), macromastia (excessively large breasts), an enlarged uterus, menstrual irregularities, and, similarly to males, accelerated bone maturation and short final height.

Development of scoliosis
Seizures or difficulty with movement
Skin and joints may become loose
Facial features change progressively; this may include:thickening of the skin
features becoming more prominent
large head
broad lower jaw
short, broad nose
rounded cheeksProgression of developmental and mental disabilities, including:progressive loss of speech
decrease in mental functioning
before school age, concentration lowers
development continues, but becomes slower than usualAn intellectual peak occurs in the mid-teens and allows a plateau for the disease. Once an individual hits the age of 25-30 the decrease begins again, including:learned skills become lost which result in severe learning disabilities
motor skills deteriorate
individuals become less mobile and more dependent(Children are physically uncoordinated, but remain able to play sports and do everyday activities until they reach adulthood.)

Ataxia (difficulty with control of movement) that is apparent early but worsens in school to pre-teen years
Oculomotor apraxia (difficulty with coordination of head and eye movement when shifting gaze from one place to the next)
Involuntary movements
Telangiectasia (dilated blood vessels) over the white (sclera) of the eyes, making them appear bloodshot. These are not apparent in infancy and may first appear at age 5–8 years. Telangiectasia may also appear on sun-exposed areas of skin.
Problems with infections, especially of the ears, sinuses and lungs
Increased incidence of cancer (primarily, but not exclusively, lymphomas and leukemias)
Delayed onset or incomplete pubertal development, and very early menopause
Slowed rate of growth (weight and/or height)
Drooling particularly in young children when they are tired or concentrating on activities
Dysarthria (slurred, slow, or distorted speech sounds)
Diabetes in adolescence or later
Premature changes in hair and skinMany children are initially misdiagnosed as having cerebral palsy. The diagnosis of A–T may not be made until the preschool years when the neurologic symptoms of impaired gait, hand coordination, speech and eye movement appear or worsen, and the telangiectasia first appear. Because A–T is so rare, doctors may not be familiar with the symptoms, or methods of making a diagnosis. The late appearance of telangiectasia may be a barrier to the diagnosis. It may also take some time before doctors consider A–T as a possibility because of the early stability of symptoms and signs. There are patients who have been diagnosed with A-T only in adulthood due to an attenuated form of the disease, and this has been correlated with the type of their gene mutation.","['HP:0000035', 'HP:0000134', 'HP:0000147', 'HP:0000246', 'HP:0000486', 'HP:0000496', 'HP:0000524', 'HP:0000639', 'HP:0000778', 'HP:0000819', 'HP:0000823', 'HP:0000957', 'HP:0001250', 'HP:0001251', 'HP:0001257', 'HP:0001260', 'HP:0001266', 'HP:0001288', 'HP:0001315', 'HP:0001332', 'HP:0001336', 'HP:0001337', 'HP:0001508', 'HP:0001595', 'HP:0001888', 'HP:0001909', 'HP:0001952', 'HP:0002110', 'HP:0002167', 'HP:0002205', 'HP:0002216', 'HP:0002664', 'HP:0002665', 'HP:0002715', 'HP:0002720', 'HP:0002721', 'HP:0002837', 'HP:0002910', 'HP:0003202', 'HP:0003220', 'HP:0004313', 'HP:0004315', 'HP:0004322', 'HP:0005357', 'HP:0005374', 'HP:0005403', 'HP:0005407', 'HP:0005599', 'HP:0005978', 'HP:0006254', 'HP:0007495', 'HP:0007565', 'HP:0008065', 'HP:0008348', 'HP:0008669', 'HP:0010515', 'HP:0010975', 'HP:0012189', 'HP:0012539', 'HP:0100022', 'HP:0100543', 'HP:0100579', 'HP:0100585']"

608583,Atrial fibrillation,"AF is usually accompanied by symptoms related to a rapid heart rate. Rapid and irregular heart rates may be perceived as the sensation of the heart beating too fast, irregularly, or skipping beats (palpitations) or exercise intolerance and occasionally may produce anginal chest pain (if the high heart rate causes the heart's demand for oxygen to increase beyond the supply of available oxygen (ischemia)). Other possible symptoms include congestive heart failure symptoms such as fatigue, shortness of breath, or swelling. The abnormal heart rhythm (arrhythmia) is sometimes only identified with the onset of a stroke or a transient ischemic attack (TIA). It is not uncommon for a person to first become aware of AF from a routine physical examination or ECG, as it often does not cause symptoms.Since most cases of AF are secondary to other medical problems, the presence of chest pain or angina, signs and symptoms of hyperthyroidism (an overactive thyroid gland) such as weight loss and diarrhea, and symptoms suggestive of lung disease can indicate an underlying cause. A history of stroke or TIA, as well as high blood pressure, diabetes, heart failure, or rheumatic fever, may indicate whether someone with AF is at a higher risk of complications. The risk of a blood clot forming in the left atrial chamber of the heart, breaking off, and then traveling in the bloodstream can be assessed using the CHADS2 or CHA2DS2-VASc score.","['HP:0001297', 'HP:0001649', 'HP:0001727', 'HP:0005110']"

218600,Baller–Gerold syndrome,"The most common and defining features of BGS are craniosynostosis and radial ray deficiency. The observations of these features allow for a diagnosis of BGS to be made, as these symptoms characterize the syndrome. Craniosynostosis involves the pre-mature fusion of bones in the skull.  The coronal craniosynostosis that is commonly seen in patients with BGS results in the fusion of the skull along the coronal suture. Because of the changes in how the bones of the skull are connected together, people with BGS will have an abnormally shaped head, known as brachycephaly. Features commonly seen in those with coronal craniosynostosis are bulging eyes, shallow eye pockets, and a prominent forehead. Radial ray deficiency is another clinical characteristic of those with BGS, and results in the under-development (hypoplasia) or the absence (aplasia) of the bones in the arms and the hands. These bones include the radius, the carpal bones associated with the radius and the thumb. Oligodactyly can also result from radial ray deficiency, meaning that someone with BGS may have fewer than five fingers. Radial ray deficiency that is associated with syndromes (such as BGS) occurs bi-laterally, affecting both arms.Some of the other clinical characteristics sometimes associated with this disorder are growth retardation and poikiloderma. Although the presentation of BGS may differ between individuals, these characteristics are often observed. People with BGS may have stunted growth, short stature and misshapen kneecaps. Poikiloderma may also be present in people with this syndrome, meaning that their skin may have regions of hyperpigmentation and hypopigmentation, or regions where the skin is missing (atrophy).","['HP:0000069', 'HP:0000076', 'HP:0000077', 'HP:0000126', 'HP:0000143', 'HP:0000160', 'HP:0000175', 'HP:0000193', 'HP:0000218', 'HP:0000238', 'HP:0000239', 'HP:0000244', 'HP:0000248', 'HP:0000275', 'HP:0000286', 'HP:0000316', 'HP:0000337', 'HP:0000347', 'HP:0000368', 'HP:0000405', 'HP:0000426', 'HP:0000430', 'HP:0000446', 'HP:0000452', 'HP:0000486', 'HP:0000494', 'HP:0000520', 'HP:0000545', 'HP:0000601', 'HP:0000639', 'HP:0000648', 'HP:0000902', 'HP:0001029', 'HP:0001163', 'HP:0001180', 'HP:0001191', 'HP:0001249', 'HP:0001250', 'HP:0001274', 'HP:0001510', 'HP:0001511', 'HP:0001531', 'HP:0001545', 'HP:0001627', 'HP:0001671', 'HP:0002007', 'HP:0002023', 'HP:0002024', 'HP:0002126', 'HP:0002650', 'HP:0002665', 'HP:0002669', 'HP:0002984', 'HP:0002996', 'HP:0003022', 'HP:0003031', 'HP:0003065', 'HP:0003196', 'HP:0003298', 'HP:0003468', 'HP:0003974', 'HP:0004231', 'HP:0004322', 'HP:0004425', 'HP:0004440', 'HP:0004442', 'HP:0004443', 'HP:0004871', 'HP:0005201', 'HP:0005792', 'HP:0005886', 'HP:0006467', 'HP:0006487', 'HP:0006498', 'HP:0006501', 'HP:0007452', 'HP:0009601', 'HP:0009702', 'HP:0010048', 'HP:0011318', 'HP:0030680', 'HP:0100542', 'HP:0100589']"

253260,Biotinidase deficiency,"Signs and symptoms of a biotinidase deficiency can appear several days after birth. These include seizures, hypotonia and muscle/limb weakness, ataxia, paresis, hearing loss, optic atrophy, skin rashes (including seborrheic dermatitis and psoriasis), and alopecia. If left untreated, the disorder can rapidly lead to coma and death.
Biotinidase deficiency can also appear later in life. This is referred to as ""late-onset"" biotinidase deficiency. The symptoms are similar, but perhaps more mild, because if an individual survives the neonatal period they likely have some residual activity of biotin-related enzymes. Studies have noted individuals who were asymptomatic until adolescence or early adulthood. One study pointed out that untreated individuals may not show symptoms until age 21. Furthermore, in rare cases, even individuals with profound deficiencies of biotinidase can be asymptomatic.Symptom severity is predictably correlated with the severity of the enzyme defect. Profound biotinidase deficiency refers to situations where enzyme activity is 10% or less. Individuals with partial biotinidase deficiency may have enzyme activity of 10-30%.Functionally, there is no significant difference between dietary biotin deficiency and genetic loss of biotin-related enzyme activity. In both cases, supplementation with biotin can often restore normal metabolic function and proper catabolism of leucine and isoleucine.
The symptoms of biotinidase deficiency (and dietary deficiency of biotin) can be quite severe. A 2004 case study from Metametrix detailed the effects of biotin deficiency, including aggression, cognitive delay, and reduced immune function.","['HP:0000365', 'HP:0000407', 'HP:0000509', 'HP:0000545', 'HP:0000572', 'HP:0000648', 'HP:0000988', 'HP:0001006', 'HP:0001051', 'HP:0001096', 'HP:0001123', 'HP:0001250', 'HP:0001251', 'HP:0001252', 'HP:0001254', 'HP:0001257', 'HP:0001259', 'HP:0001263', 'HP:0001276', 'HP:0001290', 'HP:0001317', 'HP:0001324', 'HP:0001510', 'HP:0001581', 'HP:0001596', 'HP:0001744', 'HP:0001987', 'HP:0001992', 'HP:0002013', 'HP:0002014', 'HP:0002104', 'HP:0002123', 'HP:0002240', 'HP:0002506', 'HP:0002789', 'HP:0002841', 'HP:0002883', 'HP:0005979', 'HP:0006511', 'HP:0007549', 'HP:0007730', 'HP:0008872', 'HP:0011127', 'HP:0100275', 'HP:0410145']"

Blood in the urine may also be caused by other conditions, such as bladder or ureteric stones, infection, kidney disease, kidney cancers or vascular malformations, though these conditions (except kidney cancers) would typically be painful.
Other possible symptoms include pain during urination, frequent urination, or feeling the need to urinate without being able to do so. These signs and symptoms are not specific to bladder cancer, and may also be caused by non-cancerous conditions, including prostate infections, overactive bladder or cystitis.

303700,Blue cone monochromacy,"Cone photoreceptor cells in the retina are responsible for color vision, and are categorized as L, M, and S which refer to the wavelengths of light each is sensitive to. L (long) is most sensitive to red, M (medium) to green, and S (short) to blue. L-cones and M-cones are most responsible for visual acuity as they are concentrated in the fovea centralis, the central visual field. Blue cone monochromacy is a severe condition in which the cones sensitive to red or green light are missing or defective, and only S-cones sensitive to blue light and rods which are responsible for night (scotopic) vision are functional.A variety of symptoms characterize BCM: affected individuals have low vision with a visual acuity between 20/60 and 20/200, and poor color discrimination. Phenomena such as photophobia (hemeralopia), which describes the event in which light is perceived as an intense glare, often manifest. Moreover, nystagmus is present from the age of 2 months though it may slowly decrease with age. Families with BCM-affected individuals show a recessive X-linked inheritance pattern.The majority of subjects with BCM are thought to have a stable condition, although there are cases showing evidence of disease progression and macular changes.","['HP:0000505', 'HP:0000512', 'HP:0000545', 'HP:0000613', 'HP:0000639', 'HP:0001131', 'HP:0007663', 'HP:0007703', 'HP:0007939', 'HP:0008002', 'HP:0012043']"

114480,Breast cancer,"Breast cancer most commonly presents as a lump that feels different from the rest of the breast tissue. More than 80% of cases are discovered when a person detects such a lump with the fingertips. The earliest breast cancers, however, are detected by a mammogram. Lumps found in lymph nodes located in the armpits may also indicate breast cancer.
Indications of breast cancer other than a lump may include thickening different from the other breast tissue, one breast becoming larger or lower, a nipple changing position or shape or becoming inverted, skin puckering or dimpling, a rash on or around a nipple, discharge from nipple/s, constant pain in part of the breast or armpit and swelling beneath the armpit or around the collarbone. Pain (""mastodynia"") is an unreliable tool in determining the presence or absence of breast cancer, but may be indicative of other breast health issues.Another symptom complex of breast cancer is Paget's disease of the breast. This syndrome presents as skin changes resembling eczema; such as redness, discoloration or mild flaking of the nipple skin. As Paget's disease of the breast advances, symptoms may include tingling, itching, increased sensitivity, burning, and pain. There may also be discharge from the nipple. Approximately half the women diagnosed with Paget's disease of the breast also have a lump in the breast.Inflammatory Breast Cancer presents with similar effects. Inflammatory Breast Cancer is a rare (only seen in less than 5% of breast cancer diagnosis) yet aggressive form of breast cancer characterized by the swollen, red areas formed on the top of the Breast. The visual effects of Inflammatory Breast Cancer is a result of a blockage of lymph vessels by cancer cells. This type of breast cancer is seen in more commonly diagnosed in younger ages, obese women and African American women. As inflammatory breast cancer does not present as a lump there can sometimes be a delay in diagnosis.In rare cases, what initially appears as a fibroadenoma (hard, movable non-cancerous lump) could in fact be a phyllodes tumor. Phyllodes tumors are formed within the stroma (connective tissue) of the breast and contain glandular as well as stromal tissue. Phyllodes tumors are not staged in the usual sense; they are classified on the basis of their appearance under the microscope as benign, borderline or malignant.Malignant tumors can result in metastatic tumors— secondary tumors (originating from the primary tumor) that spread beyond the site of origination. The symptoms caused by metastatic breast cancer will depend on the location of metastasis. Common sites of metastasis include bone, liver, lung, and brain. When cancer has reached such an invasive state, it is categorized as a stage 4 cancer, cancers of this state are oftentimes fatal. Common symptoms of stage 4 cancer include unexplained weight loss, bone and joint pain,  jaundice and neurological symptoms. These symptoms are called non-specific symptoms because they could be manifestations of many other illnesses.Most symptoms of breast disorders, including most lumps, do not turn out to represent underlying breast cancer. Less than 20% of lumps, for example, are cancerous, and benign breast diseases such as mastitis and fibroadenoma of the breast are more common causes of breast disorder symptoms.",['HP:0003002']

The neurological manifestations develop insidiously: they usually begin with sensorineural deafness, progress inexorably to paralysis, and often culminate in respiratory failure. Most mortality in patients has been from either respiratory infections or respiratory muscle paralysis.  Pathological descriptions of BVVL include injury and depletion of 3rd-7th cranial nerves, loss of the spinal anterior horn cells, degeneration of Purkinje cells, as well as degeneration of the spinocerebellar and pyramidal tracts.  The first symptoms in nearly all cases of BVVL is progressive vision loss and deafness, and the first initial symptoms are seen anywhere from one to three years.Most cases of deafness are followed by a latent period that can extend anywhere from weeks to years, and this time is usually marked by cranial nerve degeneration.  Neurological symptoms of BVVL include optic atrophy, cerebellar ataxia, retinitis pigmentosa, epilepsy and autonomic dysfunction.

131300,Camurati–Engelmann disease,"Patients with CED complain of chronic bone pain in the legs or arms, muscle weakness (myopathy) and experience a waddling gait. Other clinical problems associated with the disease include increased fatigue, weakness, muscle spasms, headache, difficulty gaining weight, and delay in puberty.  Some patients have an abnormal or absent tibia, may present with a flat foot, or scoliosis.This disease may also cause bones to become abnormally hardened which is referred to as sclerosis. This hardening may affect the bones at the base of the skull or those in the hands, feet, or jaw. This causes ongoing pain and aching within the body parts that are affected. The pain has been described as either a hot electric stabbing pain, an ever-increasing pressure sensation around the bones (especially before electrical storms) or as a constant ache that radiates through several long bones at once. Pain may also occur in the hips, wrists, knees and other joints as they essentially just 'lock-up' (often becoming very stiff, immobile and sore), mostly when walking up or down staircases, writing for extended periods of time, or during the colder months of the year. Those with the disease tend to have a very characteristic walk medically diagnosed as a 'waddling gait'. This is observed by the broad-based gait with a duck-like waddle to the swing phase, the pelvis drops to the side of the leg being raised, notable forward curvature of the lumbar spine and a marked body swing.The pain is especially severe during a 'flare-up', these can be unpredictable, exhausting and last anywhere from a few hours to several weeks. This is a common occurrence for several CED patients, often causing myopathy and extensive sleep deprivation from the chronic, severe and disabling pain. Patients may even require the use of a wheelchair (or additional carer's help with getting dressed, showering, mobility/shopping, preparing meals or lifting heavy items) especially when bedridden or housebound for days or weeks at a time. 'Flare-ups' may be attributed to, or exacerbated by growth spurts, stress, exhaustion, exercise, standing or walking for too long, illness, infection, being accidentally knocked/hurt or injured, after surgery/anaesthetics, cold weather, electrical storms, and sudden changes in barometric pressure.CED may also affect internal organs, the liver and spleen, which may become enlarged. A loss of vision and/or hearing can occur if bones are adversely affected by the hardening in the skull. Hence proactive specialist check-ups, X-rays, diagnostic tests/scans, and regular blood tests are recommended on an annual basis to monitor the CED bony growth and secondary medical issues that may arise from this condition.","['HP:0000016', 'HP:0000135', 'HP:0000303', 'HP:0000365', 'HP:0000501', 'HP:0000520', 'HP:0000648', 'HP:0000651', 'HP:0000670', 'HP:0000684', 'HP:0000763', 'HP:0000823', 'HP:0000925', 'HP:0000929', 'HP:0000940', 'HP:0001251', 'HP:0001293', 'HP:0001324', 'HP:0001376', 'HP:0001533', 'HP:0001639', 'HP:0001744', 'HP:0001763', 'HP:0001882', 'HP:0001903', 'HP:0001999', 'HP:0002007', 'HP:0002039', 'HP:0002167', 'HP:0002240', 'HP:0002315', 'HP:0002515', 'HP:0002644', 'HP:0002650', 'HP:0002652', 'HP:0002653', 'HP:0002673', 'HP:0002694', 'HP:0002808', 'HP:0002818', 'HP:0002823', 'HP:0002857', 'HP:0002992', 'HP:0002997', 'HP:0003034', 'HP:0003063', 'HP:0003202', 'HP:0003307', 'HP:0003388', 'HP:0003565', 'HP:0003758', 'HP:0004326', 'HP:0004396', 'HP:0005464', 'HP:0005528', 'HP:0005791', 'HP:0006501', 'HP:0007552', 'HP:0007807', 'HP:0008872', 'HP:0009763', 'HP:0010628', 'HP:0011001', 'HP:0012514', 'HP:0012544', 'HP:0032458', 'HP:0100255', 'HP:0100774']"
271900,Canavan disease,"Symptoms of the most common (and most serious) form of Canavan disease typically appear in early infancy usually between the first three to six months of age. Canavan disease then progresses rapidly from that stage, with typical cases involving intellectual disability, loss of previously acquired motor skills, feeding difficulties, abnormal muscle tone (i.e., initial floppiness - hypotonia - that may eventually translate into spasticity), poor head control, and megalocephaly (abnormally enlarged head). Paralysis, blindness, or seizures may also occur.There exists a much less common variant of Canavan disease which is generally much less serious, and involves later onset of symptoms, which are often mild and nonspecific enough to go unrecognized as manifestations of Canavan's disease. This variant does not seem to have any effect on lifespan, and is typically limited to minor cases of speech and motor skill development delay.","['HP:0000256', 'HP:0000365', 'HP:0000505', 'HP:0000618', 'HP:0000639', 'HP:0000648', 'HP:0000649', 'HP:0001250', 'HP:0001252', 'HP:0001257', 'HP:0001263', 'HP:0001276', 'HP:0001371', 'HP:0001476', 'HP:0002020', 'HP:0002179', 'HP:0002197', 'HP:0002353', 'HP:0002376', 'HP:0002977', 'HP:0004372', 'HP:0007305', 'HP:0007703', 'HP:0008872', 'HP:0012444', 'HP:0032272', 'HP:0032273', 'HP:0032274', 'HP:0100543']"

192600,"Cardiomyopathy, familial hypertrophic","The course of HCM is variable. Many people are asymptomatic or mildly symptomatic, and many of those carrying disease genes for HCM do not have clinically detectable disease. The symptoms of HCM include shortness of breath due to stiffening and decreased blood filling of the ventricles, exertional chest pain (sometimes known as angina) due to reduced blood flow to the coronary arteries, uncomfortable awareness of the heart beat (palpitations), as well as disruption of the electrical system running through the abnormal heart muscle, lightheadedness, weakness, fainting and sudden cardiac death.Shortness of breath is largely due to increased stiffness of the left ventricle (LV), which impairs filling of the ventricles, but also leads to elevated pressure in the left ventricle and left atrium, causing back pressure and interstitial congestion in the lungs. Symptoms are not closely related to the presence or severity of an outflow tract gradient. Often, symptoms mimic those of congestive heart failure (esp. activity intolerance and dyspnea), but treatment of each is different. Beta blockers are used in both cases, but treatment with diuretics, a mainstay of CHF treatment, will exacerbate symptoms in hypertrophic obstructive cardiomyopathy by decreasing ventricular preload volume and thereby increasing outflow resistance (less blood to push aside the thickened obstructing tissue).Major risk factors for sudden death in individuals with HCM include prior history of cardiac arrest or ventricular fibrillation, spontaneous sustained ventricular tachycardia, family history of premature sudden death, unexplained syncope, LVW thickness greater than 15 mm to 30 mm, abnormal exercise blood pressure and nonsustained ventricular tachycardia.""Spike and dome"" pulse and ""triple ripple apical impulse"" are two other signs that can be discovered in physical examination.","['HP:0001635', 'HP:0001670', 'HP:0001682', 'HP:0001939', 'HP:0011675']"

Other symptoms include darkening of skin color from inadequate amounts of oxygen, drowsiness, fatigue, headaches, and an inability to sleep at night.  Patients with CHS also have a sensitivity to sedatives and narcotics, which makes respiration even more difficult. A low concentration of oxygen in the red blood cells also may cause hypoxia-induced pulmonary vasoconstriction and pulmonary hypertension, culminating in cor pulmonale or a failure of the right side of the heart.

The mean age of onset of ischemic episodes is approximately 46 years (range 30–70). A classic lacunar syndrome occurs in at least two-thirds of affected patients while hemispheric strokes are much less common. It is worthy of note that ischemic strokes typically occur in the absence of traditional cardiovascular risk factors. Recurrent silent strokes, with or without clinical strokes, often lead to cognitive decline and overt subcortical dementia.

256730,"Ceroid lipofuscinosis, neuronal 1, infantile","The classic characterization of the group of neurodegenerative, lysosomal storage disorders called the neuronal ceroid lipofuscinoses (NCLs) is through the progressive, permanent loss of motor and psychological ability with a severe intracellular accumulation of lipofuscins, with the United States and northern European populations having slightly higher frequency with an occurrence of 1 in 10,000. There are four classic diagnoses that have received the most attention from researchers and the medical field, differentiated from one another by age of symptomatic onset, duration, early-onset manifestations such as blindness or seizures, and the forms which lipofuscin accumulation takes.In the early infantile variant of NCL (also called INCL or Santavuori-Haltia), probands appear normal at birth, but early visual loss leading to complete retinal blindness by the age of 2 years is the first indicator of the disease; by 3 years of age a vegetative state is reached and by 4 years isoelectric encephalograms confirm brain death. Late infantile variant usually manifests between 2 and 4 years of age with seizures and deterioration of vision. The maximum age before death for late infantile variant is 10–12 years.

275630,Chanarin–Dorfman syndrome,"Main physical signs include a fatty liver, a weakened and enlarged heart (cardiomyopathy), inflammation of the pancreas (pancreatitis), reduced thyroid activity (hypothyroidism), type 2 diabetes, abnormal levels of creatine kinase in blood, and increased weakness of proximal muscles due to fatty replacement of skeletal muscle fibers. Accurate diagnosis is complicated by symptomatic overlap with other disorders. One of the earliest symptoms to manifest clinically is peripheral limb weakness, which becomes progressively more severe over time. Specifically, asymmetric right shoulder weakness is an idiosyncratic hallmark of NLSD enabling it to be distinguished from myopathies arising from alternative muscular disorders. 
NLSD is often diagnosed by the presence of lipid inclusions within leukocytes (Jordan’ Anomaly), which can be detected using histochemical and electron microscopy. Image B shows the characteristic lipid accumulation in red blood cells, in a NLSD patient, as compared to a normal individual (Image A).
Classically, NLSD is associated with myopathy and can, in some cases, be linked with icthyosis. Therefore, with these symptoms or diagnosis, it is likely that the patient could and would be diagnosed with NLSD.
Although lipid accumulation is most prominent in  myocytes, hepatocytes, and granulocytes, other tissues displayed elevated deposits as well. For the purpose of diagnosis, MRIs have been used to identify large fat deposits within muscle tissue. 
People can live with NLSD, but there can be complications due to the affects this disease has on other major parts of the body like the liver, the heart, and skeletal muscle. Whereas myopathy won’t necessarily show up until a patient is in the third decade of their life, a child born with ichthyosis, is immediately evaluated for NLSD, in which it is detected very early on. Also, the earlier that NLSD can be detected and symptoms treated, the better quality of life the patient can have.","['HP:0000232', 'HP:0000385', 'HP:0000407', 'HP:0000486', 'HP:0000508', 'HP:0000523', 'HP:0000639', 'HP:0000656', 'HP:0001006', 'HP:0001249', 'HP:0001251', 'HP:0001263', 'HP:0001284', 'HP:0001324', 'HP:0001397', 'HP:0001413', 'HP:0001513', 'HP:0001596', 'HP:0001638', 'HP:0001871', 'HP:0001911', 'HP:0001946', 'HP:0002155', 'HP:0002240', 'HP:0002355', 'HP:0002910', 'HP:0002922', 'HP:0003198', 'HP:0003458', 'HP:0003547', 'HP:0004322', 'HP:0007009', 'HP:0007479', 'HP:0008551', 'HP:0009073', 'HP:0012240', 'HP:0012472', 'HP:0040081']"

214500,Chédiak–Higashi syndrome,"People with CHS have light skin and silvery hair (albinism) and frequently complain of solar sensitivity and photophobia. Other signs and symptoms vary considerably, but frequent infections and neuropathy are common. The infections involve mucous membranes, skin, and the respiratory tract. Affected children are susceptible to infection by Gram-positive and gram-negative bacteria and fungi, with Staphylococcus aureus being the most common infectious cause. Infections in CHS patients tend to be very serious and even life-threatening. Neuropathy often begins in the teenage years and becomes the most prominent problem. Few patients with this condition live to adulthood.
Most children with Chédiak–Higashi syndrome ultimately reach a stage known as the ""accelerated phase"", or the ""lymphoma-like syndrome"", in which defective white blood cells divide uncontrollably and invade many of the body's organs. The accelerated phase is associated with fever, episodes of abnormal bleeding, overwhelming infections, and organ failure. These medical problems are usually life-threatening in childhood.","['HP:0000225', 'HP:0000230', 'HP:0000315', 'HP:0000421', 'HP:0000478', 'HP:0000486', 'HP:0000504', 'HP:0000505', 'HP:0000613', 'HP:0000639', 'HP:0000646', 'HP:0000704', 'HP:0000762', 'HP:0000952', 'HP:0000969', 'HP:0000978', 'HP:0000995', 'HP:0001010', 'HP:0001104', 'HP:0001249', 'HP:0001250', 'HP:0001251', 'HP:0001263', 'HP:0001265', 'HP:0001272', 'HP:0001284', 'HP:0001288', 'HP:0001324', 'HP:0001337', 'HP:0001631', 'HP:0001744', 'HP:0001873', 'HP:0001875', 'HP:0001881', 'HP:0001882', 'HP:0001903', 'HP:0001945', 'HP:0002063', 'HP:0002067', 'HP:0002071', 'HP:0002180', 'HP:0002205', 'HP:0002239', 'HP:0002240', 'HP:0002376', 'HP:0002665', 'HP:0002716', 'HP:0002721', 'HP:0003401', 'HP:0005406', 'HP:0005429', 'HP:0005592', 'HP:0005599', 'HP:0006824', 'HP:0007133', 'HP:0007440', 'HP:0007513', 'HP:0007663', 'HP:0007730', 'HP:0009027', 'HP:0009830', 'HP:0011358', 'HP:0011364', 'HP:0012145', 'HP:0100022', 'HP:0100838', 'HP:0200042']"
118400,Cherubism,"The appearance of people with the disorder is caused by a loss of bone in the mandible which the body replaces with excessive amounts of fibrous tissue. In most cases, the condition fades as the child grows, but in rare cases the condition continues to deform the affected person's face. Cherubism also causes premature loss of the primary teeth and lack of eruption of the permanent teeth.
Cherubism is a rare autosomal dominant disease of the maxilla and mandible. Approximately 200 cases have been reported by medical journals with the majority being males. Cherubism is usually first diagnosed around age 7 and continues through puberty and may or may not continue to advance with age. Degrees of cherubism vary from mild to severe. Osteoclastic and osteoblastic remodeling contributes to the change of normal bone to fibrous tissue and cyst formation. As noted by the name, the patient's face becomes enlarged and disproportionate due to the fibrous tissue and atypical bone formation. The sponge-like bone formations lead to early tooth loss and permanent tooth eruption problems. The condition also affects the orbital area, creating an upturned eye appearance. The cause of cherubism is believed to be traced to a genetic defect resulting from a mutation of the SH3BP2 gene from chromosome 4p16.3. While the condition is rare and painless, the afflicted suffer the emotional trauma of disfigurement. The effects of cherubism may also interfere with normal jaw motion and speech. Currently, removal of the tissue and bone by surgery is the only treatment available. This condition is also one of the few that unexpectedly stops and regresses. Normal bone remodeling activity may resume after puberty.
Cherubism is displayed with genetic conformation and when excessive osteoclasts are found in the affected areas of the mandible and maxilla. Large cysts will be present with excessive fibrous areas inside the bone. The fibers and cysts will be found among the trabecula of the Coronoid process, the ramus of mandible, the body of mandible and the maxilla regions. The maxilla will be affected up to and including the orbits and sometimes inside the lower orbits. The maxilla and zygomatic bones are depressed and eyes appear to gaze upward.   The maxilla has been found to be more severely affected in most cases than the mandible bone. Some patients found with lower inner orbital growths and cysts may lose vision.","['HP:0000164', 'HP:0000277', 'HP:0000293', 'HP:0000311', 'HP:0000505', 'HP:0000520', 'HP:0000529', 'HP:0000648', 'HP:0000677', 'HP:0001065', 'HP:0001133', 'HP:0001138', 'HP:0001608', 'HP:0002781', 'HP:0002870', 'HP:0006482', 'HP:0007663', 'HP:0008872', 'HP:0012062', 'HP:0012802', 'HP:0030802', 'HP:0200056', 'HP:0200057']"

An ultrasound examination shows accumulation of chalky material (calcification) in the adrenal gland in about half of infants with LAL-D. Complications of LAL-D progress over time, eventually leading to life-threatening problems such as extremely low levels of circulating red blood cells (severe anemia), liver dysfunction or failure, and physical wasting (cachexia).People who are older children or adults generally present with a wide range of signs and symptoms that overlap with other disorders.

The serum creatine kinase is often elevated in the body of the people who are affected by this disease.People afflicted by this disease also experience a loss of neurons. Loss of neurons is a hallmark of neurodegenerative diseases. Due to the generally non-regenerative nature of neuronal cells in the adult central nervous system, this results in an irreversible and fatal process of neurodegeneration.

246700,Chylomicron retention disease,"Physical symptoms of CMRD involving development and function of the gastrointestinal tract and nervous system typically manifest  between  infancy and adolescence. The symptoms of CmRD are similar to the physical symptoms  of malnutrition, as the disease arises due to the poor absorption of lipids and fat-soluble nutrients such as vitamin E. For this reason, the disease is likely to be under-diagnosed by physicians . Fat-soluble nutrients are essential for growth, development, and normal bodily function. Vitamin E deficiency is especially serious , as the vitamin is necessary for proper neurological function and development. Without Vitamin E, neurons cannot operate correctly and signals from the brain are weakened. This leads to reduced muscle development and reduced muscle contraction.
Symptoms that manifest in the GI tract are likely to be a consequence of both reduced absorption of fats and physiological stress imposed on enterocytes that can not shuttle fats into circulation . Additional symptoms that occur throughout the body can be attributed to the lack of sufficient lipid sources.
Chronic Malabsorptive Diarrhea- Diarrhea that results from the poor absorption of fats
Steatorrhea- Abnormal stools, often foul smelling, due to the increased presence of undigested fats
Vomiting
Vitamin E Deficiency- Low levels of Vitamin E due to the malabsorption of fats in the diet, causes poor brain, muscle, and eye development.
Cardiomyopathy- A class of disease that affects heart muscle, causing shortness of breath, tiredness, and swelling of the legs
Slowed Growth
Failure to Thrive- Insufficient weight gain, or drastic levels of weight loss in children
Hypercholesterolemia- Low blood cholesterol levels

119600,Cleidocranial dysplasia,"Cleidocranial dysostosis is a general skeletal condition so named from the collarbone (cleido-) and cranium deformities which people with it often have.
People with the condition usually present with a painless swelling in the area of the clavicles at 2–3 years of age. Common features are:

Clavicles (collarbones) can be partly missing leaving only the medial part of the bone. In 10% of cases, they are completely missing. If the collarbones are completely missing or reduced to small vestiges, this allows hypermobility of the shoulders including ability to touch the shoulders together in front of the chest. The defect is bilateral 80% of the time. Partial collarbones may cause nerve damage symptoms and therefore have to be removed by surgery.
The mandible is prognathic due to hypoplasia of maxilla (micrognathism) and other facial bones.
A soft spot or larger soft area in the top of the head where the fontanelle failed to close, or the fontanelle closes late.
Bones and joints are underdeveloped. People are shorter and their frames are smaller than their siblings who do not have the condition.
The permanent teeth include supernumerary teeth. Unless these supernumeraries are removed they will crowd the adult teeth in what already may be an underdeveloped jaw. If so, the supernumeraries will probably need to be removed to make space for the adult teeth. Up to 13 supernumerary teeth have been observed. Teeth may also be displaced. Cementum formation may be deficient.
Failure of eruption of permanent teeth.
Bossing (bulging) of the forehead.
Open skull sutures, large fontanelles.
Hypertelorism.
Delayed ossification of bones forming symphysis pubis, producing a widened symphysis.
Coxa vara can occur, limiting abduction and causing Trendelenburg gait.
Short middle fifth phalanges, sometimes causing short and wide fingers.
Vertebral abnormalities.
On rare occasions, brachial plexus irritation can occur.
Scoliosis, spina bifida and syringomyelia have also been described.Other features are: parietal  bossing, basilar invagination (atlantoaxial impaction), persistent metopic suture, abnormal  ear structures with hearing loss, supernumerary ribs, hemivertebrae with spondylosis,  small and high scapulae, hypoplasia of illiac bones, absence of the pubic bone, short / absent fibular bones, short / absent  radial bones, hypoplastic terminal phalanges.","['HP:0000162', 'HP:0000164', 'HP:0000175', 'HP:0000189', 'HP:0000218', 'HP:0000239', 'HP:0000242', 'HP:0000246', 'HP:0000248', 'HP:0000256', 'HP:0000272', 'HP:0000303', 'HP:0000316', 'HP:0000337', 'HP:0000340', 'HP:0000347', 'HP:0000364', 'HP:0000365', 'HP:0000389', 'HP:0000670', 'HP:0000680', 'HP:0000682', 'HP:0000684', 'HP:0000696', 'HP:0000772', 'HP:0000773', 'HP:0000774', 'HP:0000882', 'HP:0000891', 'HP:0000894', 'HP:0000939', 'HP:0001156', 'HP:0001163', 'HP:0001172', 'HP:0001182', 'HP:0001810', 'HP:0002007', 'HP:0002098', 'HP:0002205', 'HP:0002643', 'HP:0002644', 'HP:0002645', 'HP:0002650', 'HP:0002652', 'HP:0002659', 'HP:0002684', 'HP:0002688', 'HP:0002689', 'HP:0002700', 'HP:0002705', 'HP:0002738', 'HP:0002757', 'HP:0002808', 'HP:0002812', 'HP:0002857', 'HP:0002866', 'HP:0003183', 'HP:0003298', 'HP:0003302', 'HP:0003304', 'HP:0003396', 'HP:0004209', 'HP:0004220', 'HP:0004322', 'HP:0004331', 'HP:0004474', 'HP:0005107', 'HP:0005259', 'HP:0005280', 'HP:0005930', 'HP:0006040', 'HP:0006297', 'HP:0006660', 'HP:0008391', 'HP:0008788', 'HP:0008821', 'HP:0008848', 'HP:0009577', 'HP:0010230', 'HP:0010535', 'HP:0010669', 'HP:0010751', 'HP:0010807', 'HP:0011001', 'HP:0011069', 'HP:0011219', 'HP:0011800', 'HP:0100864', 'HP:0200021']"
216360,COACH syndrome,"Signs of COACH syndrome tend to present from birth to early childhood. Facial abnormalities are a common symptom, with some characteristics being broadness of the forehead, ptosis of either one or both eyes and misalignment of the eyes. Other cases also report a ""carp"" shaped mouth, flattened face and nose and hypertelorism.Patients are often within the lower percentiles for height and weight growth. Hypotonia is a possible sign of COACH syndrome. Infants suffering from COACH syndrome may experience very categorical hyperventilation and complications with respiration, such as irregular breathing. It has been reported that as patients surpass infancy, these respiratory issues may disappear.Behavioral and intellectual delays are symptoms caused by the hypoplasia of the cerebellar vermis and oligophrenia. This implies delayed onset of speech and walking, along with learning and social issues. Poor motor skills and balance, speech impairment, mild gait or hand ataxia and irregular eye movement are symptoms of the disease attributed to congential ataxia.Coloboma of the eye is visible in the retina as ""hole"" in its structure, and causes low vision, possible sensitivity to light and variance in size of the eyeball. The build-up of tissue in the liver, known as hepatic fibrosis, may cause symptoms such as jaundice, ascites, abnormal bleeding and enlarged spleen. Kidney complications in the form of polycystic kidney or nephronophthisis is estimated to affect 77% of patients suffering from COACH syndrome, and is therefore a highly significant symptom of the disease.","['HP:0000003', 'HP:0000023', 'HP:0000083', 'HP:0000090', 'HP:0000112', 'HP:0000154', 'HP:0000202', 'HP:0000238', 'HP:0000256', 'HP:0000276', 'HP:0000311', 'HP:0000316', 'HP:0000369', 'HP:0000426', 'HP:0000463', 'HP:0000486', 'HP:0000505', 'HP:0000508', 'HP:0000567', 'HP:0000588', 'HP:0000589', 'HP:0000612', 'HP:0000639', 'HP:0000657', 'HP:0000822', 'HP:0000864', 'HP:0001162', 'HP:0001250', 'HP:0001251', 'HP:0001252', 'HP:0001257', 'HP:0001263', 'HP:0001288', 'HP:0001290', 'HP:0001320', 'HP:0001337', 'HP:0001347', 'HP:0001394', 'HP:0001395', 'HP:0001409', 'HP:0001438', 'HP:0001510', 'HP:0001744', 'HP:0002085', 'HP:0002104', 'HP:0002240', 'HP:0002269', 'HP:0002342', 'HP:0002419', 'HP:0002553', 'HP:0002612', 'HP:0002617', 'HP:0002650', 'HP:0002793', 'HP:0002896', 'HP:0002910', 'HP:0004422', 'HP:0005248', 'HP:0006817', 'HP:0007360', 'HP:0007370', 'HP:0008659', 'HP:0008872', 'HP:0100626']"

303600,Coffin–Lowry syndrome,"There is no cure for Coffin-Lowry syndrome.  Clinical objectives are centered on symptom management. Because stimulus-induced drop attacks (SIDAs) can result in physical harm to patients with the disorder, the use of medication to prevent or reduce the number of SIDA episodes is a safety priority.  Physical precautionary measures have also been used to protect patients from injury, including the use of a helmet or a wheelchair. Because sudden excitement or fright can trigger a SIDA episode it is important to minimize exposure to startling stimuli. Medications prescribed include benzodiazepines (tranquilizers used to treat anxiety), valproate (used to manage epilepsy and bipolar disorder), and selective serotonin reuptake inhibitors (SSRIs) (used to treat major depression).  When affected individuals display aggressive or destructive behavior that could harm themselves or others, the antipsychotic medication risperidone may eventually be prescribed. It is recommended that spinal development be monitored regularly by x-ray and physical exams. Echocardiograms are recommended every 5-10 years to assess cardiac function and development.

Characteristic signs and symptoms may include birth defects such as congenital heart disease, defects in the palate, most commonly related to neuromuscular problems with closure (velopharyngeal insufficiency), learning disabilities, mild differences in facial features, and recurrent infections.  Infections are common in children due to problems with the immune system's T cell-mediated response that in some patients is due to an absent or hypoplastic thymus. DiGeorge syndrome may be first spotted when an affected newborn has heart defects or convulsions from hypocalcemia due to malfunctioning parathyroid glands and low levels of parathyroid hormone (parathormone).
Affected individuals may also have other kinds of birth defects including kidney abnormalities and significant feeding difficulties as babies. Gastrointestinal issues are also very
common in this patient population. Digestive motility issues may result in constipation. Disorders such as hypothyroidism and hypoparathyroidism or thrombocytopenia (low platelet levels), and psychiatric illnesses are common late-occurring features.Microdeletions in chromosomal region 22q11.2 are associated with a 20 to 30-fold increased risk of schizophrenia.

158350,Cowden syndrome,"As Cowden's disease is a multi-system disorder, the physical manifestations are broken down by organ system:
Skin
Adolescent patients affected with Cowden syndrome develop characteristic lesions called trichilemmomas, which typically develop on the face, and verrucous papules around the mouth and on the ears. Oral papillomas are also common. Furthermore, shiny palmar keratoses with central dells are also present. At birth or in childhood, classic features of Cowden's include pigmented genital lesions, lipomas, epidermal nevi, and cafe-au-lait spots. Squamous cell carcinomas of the skin may also occur.Thyroid
Two thirds of patients suffer from thyroid disorders, and these typically include benign follicular adenomas or multinodular goiter of the thyroid. Additionally, Cowden's patients are more susceptible to developing thyroid cancer than the general population. It is estimated that less than 10 percent of individuals with Cowden syndrome may develop follicular thyroid cancer. Cases of papillary thyroid cancer have been reported as well.Female and Male Genitourinary
Females have an elevated risk of developing endometrial cancers, which is highest for those under the age of 50. Currently, it is not clear whether uterine leiomyomata (fibroids) or congenital genitourinary abnormalities occur at an increased rate in Cowden syndrome patients as compared to the general population. The occurrence of multiple testicular lipomas, or testicular lipomatosis, is a characteristic finding in male patients with Cowden syndrome.Gastrointestinal
Polyps are extremely common as they are found in about 95% of Cowden syndrome patients undergoing a colonoscopy. They are numerous ranging from a few to hundreds, usually of the hamartomatous subtype, and distributed across the colon as well as other areas within the gastrointestinal tract. Other types of polyps that may be encountered less frequently include ganglioneuromatous, adenomatous, and lymphoid polyps. Diffuse glycogenic acanthosis of the esophagus is another gastrointestinal manifestation associated with Cowden syndrome.Breast
Females are at an increased risk of developing breast cancer, which is the most common malignancy observed in Cowden's patients. Although some cases have been reported, there is not enough evidence to indicate an association between Cowden syndrome and the development of male breast cancer. Up to 75% demonstrate benign breast conditions such as intraductal papillomatosis, fibroadenomas, and fibrocystic changes. However, there is currently not enough evidence to determine if benign breast disease occurs more frequently in Cowden's patients as compared to individuals without a hereditary cancer syndrome.Central Nervous System
Macrocephaly is observed in 84% of patients with Cowden syndrome. It typically occurs due to an abnormally enlarged brain, or megalencepahly. Patients may also exhibit dolichocephaly. Varying degrees of autism spectrum disorder and intellectual disability have been reported as well. Lhermitte-Duclos disease is a benign cerebellar tumor that typically does not manifest until adulthood in patients with Cowden syndrome.","['HP:0000034', 'HP:0000138', 'HP:0000160', 'HP:0000218', 'HP:0000221', 'HP:0000327', 'HP:0000347', 'HP:0000365', 'HP:0000518', 'HP:0000545', 'HP:0000767', 'HP:0000771', 'HP:0000821', 'HP:0000836', 'HP:0000853', 'HP:0000854', 'HP:0000972', 'HP:0001031', 'HP:0001102', 'HP:0001249', 'HP:0001250', 'HP:0001256', 'HP:0001263', 'HP:0001888', 'HP:0002080', 'HP:0002253', 'HP:0002597', 'HP:0002650', 'HP:0002719', 'HP:0002808', 'HP:0002858', 'HP:0003002', 'HP:0004313', 'HP:0004390', 'HP:0004481', 'HP:0006740', 'HP:0007206', 'HP:0010609', 'HP:0010619', 'HP:0012871', 'HP:0025318', 'HP:0030731', 'HP:0100646', 'HP:0200016', 'HP:0500009']"

There is a genotype-phenotype correlation across the L1 spectrum, meaning that the specific genetic variant causing an L1-spectrum disorder in a patient determines the severity of the L1 syndrome in that patient. Patients with truncating (loss-of-function) variants in L1CAM, which prevent the full synthesis of L1 (protein) experience more severe features than patients with missense variants in L1CAM, which may result in an abnormal protein but do not prevent its synthesis. Illustrating this difference in L1 syndrome severity, up to 50% of infants born with L1 syndrome caused by a truncating mutation will die before the age of 3 years despite provision of best available medical treatment. In comparison, roughly 10% of infants born with L1 syndrome caused by a missense mutation will die before the age of 3 years.Despite its presentation on a continuous spectrum, L1 syndrome is loosely divided into four discrete phenotypes.","['HP:0000238', 'HP:0000252', 'HP:0000256', 'HP:0000486', 'HP:0000750', 'HP:0001181', 'HP:0001188', 'HP:0001249', 'HP:0001258', 'HP:0001274', 'HP:0001288', 'HP:0001347', 'HP:0001761', 'HP:0001762', 'HP:0002061', 'HP:0002119', 'HP:0002362', 'HP:0002381', 'HP:0002808', 'HP:0003307', 'HP:0004209', 'HP:0004322', 'HP:0004374', 'HP:0010550', 'HP:0100490']"

Myoclonus (jerky movements) typically occurs in 90% of cases, but may be absent at initial onset. Other frequently occurring features include anxiety, depression, paranoia, obsessive-compulsive symptoms, and psychosis. This is accompanied by physical problems such as speech impairment, balance and coordination dysfunction (ataxia), changes in gait, and rigid posture. In most people with CJD, these symptoms are accompanied by involuntary movements. The duration of the disease varies greatly, but sporadic (non-inherited) CJD can be fatal within months or even weeks. Most victims die six months after initial symptoms appear, often of pneumonia due to impaired coughing reflexes. About 15% of people with CJD survive for two or more years.The symptoms of CJD are caused by the progressive death of the brain's nerve cells, which are associated with the build-up of abnormal prion proteins forming in the brain. When brain tissue from a person with CJD is examined under a microscope, many tiny holes can be seen where the nerve cells have died. Parts of the brain may resemble a sponge where the prion were infecting the areas of the brain.","['HP:0000504', 'HP:0000505', 'HP:0000605', 'HP:0000639', 'HP:0000712', 'HP:0000716', 'HP:0000726', 'HP:0000736', 'HP:0000737', 'HP:0000738', 'HP:0000739', 'HP:0000741', 'HP:0000746', 'HP:0000751', 'HP:0001250', 'HP:0001269', 'HP:0001289', 'HP:0001317', 'HP:0001324', 'HP:0001336', 'HP:0001337', 'HP:0001350', 'HP:0002066', 'HP:0002067', 'HP:0002072', 'HP:0002073', 'HP:0002283', 'HP:0002312', 'HP:0002354', 'HP:0002381', 'HP:0002401', 'HP:0002446', 'HP:0002464', 'HP:0002529', 'HP:0002922', 'HP:0003487', 'HP:0005327', 'HP:0006943', 'HP:0007009', 'HP:0007017', 'HP:0007076', 'HP:0007158', 'HP:0007183', 'HP:0007256', 'HP:0007686', 'HP:0010542', 'HP:0010846', 'HP:0011099', 'HP:0012332', 'HP:0012672', 'HP:0025152', 'HP:0100256', 'HP:0100292', 'HP:0100661', 'HP:0100785', 'HP:0100786']"

123500,Crouzon syndrome,"A defining characteristic of Crouzon syndrome is craniosynostosis, which results in an abnormal head shape. This is present in combinations of: turricephaly, frontal bossing, trigonocephaly (fusion of the metopic suture), brachycephaly (fusion of the coronal suture), dolichocephaly (fusion of the sagittal suture), plagiocephaly (unilateral premature closure of lambdoid and coronal sutures), oxycephaly (fusion of coronal and lambdoidal sutures), and complex craniosynostosis (premature closure of some or all sutures).
Exophthalmos (bulging eyes due to shallow eye sockets after early fusion of surrounding bones), hypertelorism (greater than normal distance between the eyes), and psittichorhina (beak-like nose) are also very common features. Other facial characteristics that are present in many cases include external strabismus and hypoplastic maxilla (insufficient growth of the midface), which results in relative mandibular prognathism (protruding chin) and gives the effect of the patient having a concave face.Most symptoms are secondary to the abnormal skull structure. Approximately 30% of people with Crouzon syndrome develop hydrocephalus. Sensorineural hearing loss is present in some cases. The abnormalities in the manner in which the eyes fit in the eye sockets can cause vision problems, the most common of which is corneal exposure that can lead to visual impairment. Some people with the condition have a restricted airway and can experience severe problems breathing.Common features are a narrow/high-arched palate, posterior bilateral crossbite, hypodontia (missing some teeth), and crowding of teeth. Due to maxillary hypoplasia, people with Crouzon syndrome generally have a considerable permanent underbite.","['HP:0000189', 'HP:0000238', 'HP:0000248', 'HP:0000262', 'HP:0000303', 'HP:0000316', 'HP:0000327', 'HP:0000348', 'HP:0000365', 'HP:0000405', 'HP:0000413', 'HP:0000444', 'HP:0000453', 'HP:0000486', 'HP:0000491', 'HP:0000505', 'HP:0000508', 'HP:0000509', 'HP:0000520', 'HP:0000586', 'HP:0000612', 'HP:0000646', 'HP:0000648', 'HP:0000678', 'HP:0000929', 'HP:0000956', 'HP:0000995', 'HP:0001053', 'HP:0001249', 'HP:0001250', 'HP:0001321', 'HP:0001739', 'HP:0001999', 'HP:0002007', 'HP:0002093', 'HP:0002308', 'HP:0002315', 'HP:0002516', 'HP:0003319', 'HP:0004439', 'HP:0004440', 'HP:0004442', 'HP:0004443', 'HP:0005107', 'HP:0010535', 'HP:0011324', 'HP:0011386', 'HP:0011800', 'HP:0100621']"

219700,Cystic fibrosis,"The main signs and symptoms of cystic fibrosis are salty-tasting skin, poor growth, and poor weight gain despite normal food intake, accumulation of thick, sticky mucus, frequent chest infections, and coughing or shortness of breath. Males can be infertile due to congenital absence of the vas deferens. Symptoms often appear in infancy and childhood, such as bowel obstruction due to meconium ileus in newborn babies.As the children grow, they  exercise to release mucus in the alveoli. Epithelial cells in the person have a mutated protein that leads to abnormally viscous mucus production. The poor growth in children typically presents as an inability to gain weight or height at the same rate as their peers, and is occasionally not diagnosed until investigation is initiated for poor growth. The causes of growth failure are multifactorial and include chronic lung infection, poor absorption of nutrients through the gastrointestinal tract, and increased metabolic demand due to chronic illness.In rare cases, cystic fibrosis can manifest itself as a coagulation disorder. Vitamin K is normally absorbed from breast milk, formula, and later, solid foods. This absorption is impaired in some cystic fibrosis patients. Young children are especially sensitive to vitamin K malabsorptive disorders because only a very small amount of vitamin K crosses the placenta, leaving the child with very low reserves and limited ability to absorb vitamin K from dietary sources after birth. Because factors II, VII, IX, and X (clotting factors) are vitamin K–dependent, low levels of vitamin K can result in coagulation problems. Consequently, when a child presents with unexplained bruising, a coagulation evaluation may be warranted to determine whether an underlying disease is present.","['HP:0001508', 'HP:0001648', 'HP:0001738', 'HP:0001944', 'HP:0002024', 'HP:0002035', 'HP:0002099', 'HP:0002110', 'HP:0002150', 'HP:0002205', 'HP:0002206', 'HP:0002240', 'HP:0002613', 'HP:0002721', 'HP:0003251', 'HP:0004313', 'HP:0004401', 'HP:0006528', 'HP:0006532', 'HP:0006538', 'HP:0012236']"

124200,Darier disease,"Diagnosis of Darier disease is often made by the appearance of the skin, family history, or genetic testing for the mutation in the ATP2A2 gene. However, many individuals affected by this disorder are never diagnosed, due to the mildness of symptoms in most cases. Mild cases present clinically are minor rashes (without odor) that can become exacerbated by heat, humidity, stress, and sunlight. The symptoms of the disease are thought to be caused by an abnormality in the desmosome-keratin filament complex leading to a breakdown in cell adhesion.

Darier's disease is an incommunicable disorder that is seen in males and females equally. Symptoms typically arise between the ages of 15 and 30.  One study of 100 British individuals diagnosed with Darier's disease reported that affected individuals display elevated frequencies of neuropsychiatric conditions. There were high lifetime rates for mood disorders (50%), including depression (30%), bipolar disorder (4%), suicidal thoughts (31%), and suicide attempts (13%), suggesting a possible common genetic link.  Several case studies have suggested affected populations display elevated frequencies of learning disorders, but this has yet to be confirmed.

Clinical symptoms that are often used in the diagnosis of the disease:

In most cases, celiac disease is diagnosed after onset of type 1 diabetes. The association of celiac disease with type 1 diabetes increases the risk of complications, such as retinopathy and mortality. This association can be explained by shared genetic factors, and inflammation or nutritional deficiencies caused by untreated celiac disease, even if type 1 diabetes is diagnosed first.Some people with type 1 diabetes experience dramatic and recurrent swings in glucose levels, often occurring for no apparent reason; this is called ""unstable diabetes"", ""labile diabetes"" or ""brittle diabetes"". The results of such swings can be irregular and unpredictable hyperglycemias, sometimes involving ketoacidosis, and sometimes serious hypoglycemias.

222730,Dicarboxylic aminoaciduria,"Dicarboxylic aminoaciduria involves excretion of urinary glutamate and aspartate, resulting from the incomplete reabsorption of anionic amino acids from the glomerular filtrate in the kidney. This affects a diseased individual's amino acid pool, as they will have to spend additional resources to replenish the amino acids which would have otherwise been present. Additionally, glutamate transporters are responsible for the synaptic release of the glutamate (neurotransmitter) within the interneuronal synaptic cleft. This hindrance of functionality in individuals with dicarboxylic aminoaciduria may be related to growth retardation, intellectual disability, and a tendency toward fasting hypoglycemia and ketoacidosis. Dicarboxylic aminoaciduria is diagnosed by finding the increased presence of glutamate and aspartate in the urine.","['HP:0000787', 'HP:0001249', 'HP:0003162', 'HP:0003355', 'HP:0032401']"

Characteristic signs and symptoms may include birth defects such as congenital heart disease, defects in the palate, most commonly related to neuromuscular problems with closure (velopharyngeal insufficiency), learning disabilities, mild differences in facial features, and recurrent infections.  Infections are common in children due to problems with the immune system's T cell-mediated response that in some patients is due to an absent or hypoplastic thymus. DiGeorge syndrome may be first spotted when an affected newborn has heart defects or convulsions from hypocalcemia due to malfunctioning parathyroid glands and low levels of parathyroid hormone (parathormone).
Affected individuals may also have other kinds of birth defects including kidney abnormalities and significant feeding difficulties as babies. Gastrointestinal issues are also very
common in this patient population. Digestive motility issues may result in constipation. Disorders such as hypothyroidism and hypoparathyroidism or thrombocytopenia (low platelet levels), and psychiatric illnesses are common late-occurring features.Microdeletions in chromosomal region 22q11.2 are associated with a 20 to 30-fold increased risk of schizophrenia.

223360,Dopamine beta-hydroxylase deficiency,"Dopamine beta (β)-hydroxylase deficiency is a condition that affects the autonomic nervous system (ANS). The ANS works via two opposing branches, the sympathetic and parasympathetic, both of which antagonistically control involuntary processes that regulate bodily homeostasis. Problems related to DβH deficiency often first appear as complications shortly after birth. Postnatal episodes may include vomiting, dehydration, hypotension, muscle hypotonia, hypothermia, and hypoglycemia.Due to the deficiency of norepinephrine and epinephrine those affected by dopamine β-hydroxylase deficiency may present with droopy eyelids (ptosis), nasal congestion, and hypotension. The most common complaint of individuals with dopamine β-hydroxylase deficiency is orthostatic hypotension. The symptoms associated with orthostatic hypotension are dizziness, blurred vision, or fainting upon standing. Therefore, DβH deficiency patients may have an inability to stand for a prolonged period of time. This phenomenon is especially pronounced when going from supine to upright positions, such as getting out of bed in the morning. It is also worsened by extreme climates due to loss of fluid through excessive sweating. The inability to maintain normal blood pressure makes it difficult for people with DβH deficiency to exercise (exercise intolerance). Males with DβH deficiency may experience retrograde ejaculation, a discharge of semen backward into the bladder due to dysmotility of their smooth muscle, which as innervated by the ANS. A subset of DβH deficiency patients present with hypermobility. Postural orthostatic tachycardia syndrome, another form of dysautonomia, also sees this comorbidity with hypermobility in the form of a rare connective tissue disorder called Ehlers Danlos syndrome.
Another commonly experienced symptom is hypoglycemia, which is thought to be caused by adrenomedullary failure. In looking at the cardiovascular system, a loss of noradrenergic control is seen as T-wave abnormalities on electrocardiogram. Prolactin is frequently suppressed by excessive dopamine found in the patient's central nervous system. Excess dopamine can also affect digestion, producing vomiting and inhibiting motor signaling to the GI tract.","['HP:0000017', 'HP:0000218', 'HP:0000508', 'HP:0000622', 'HP:0000842', 'HP:0000855', 'HP:0001250', 'HP:0001252', 'HP:0001278', 'HP:0001279', 'HP:0001315', 'HP:0001488', 'HP:0001903', 'HP:0001943', 'HP:0001944', 'HP:0001998', 'HP:0002013', 'HP:0002014', 'HP:0002045', 'HP:0002094', 'HP:0002321', 'HP:0002360', 'HP:0003115', 'HP:0003138', 'HP:0003259', 'HP:0005964', 'HP:0009020', 'HP:0011979', 'HP:0012378', 'HP:0012384', 'HP:0012670', 'HP:0012877', 'HP:0100749']"

607208,Dravet syndrome,"Dravet syndrome has been characterized by prolonged febrile and non-febrile seizures within the first year of a child’s life. This disease progresses to other seizure types like myoclonic and partial seizures, psychomotor delay, and ataxia. It is characterized by cognitive impairment, behavioral disorders, and motor deficits. Behavioral deficits often include hyperactivity and impulsiveness, and in more rare cases, autistic-like behaviors. Dravet syndrome is also associated with sleep disorders including somnolence and insomnia.  The seizures experienced by people with Dravet syndrome become worse as the patient ages, as the disease is not very observable when symptoms first appear. This coupled with the range of severity differing between each individual diagnosed and the resistance of these seizures to drugs has made it challenging to develop treatments.Dravet syndrome appears during the first year of life, often beginning around six months of age with frequent febrile seizures (fever-related seizures). Children with Dravet syndrome typically experience a lagged development of language and motor skills, hyperactivity and sleep difficulties, chronic infection, growth and balance issues, and difficulty relating to others. The effects of this disorder do not diminish over time, and children diagnosed with Dravet syndrome require fully committed caretakers with tremendous patience and the ability to closely monitor them.Febrile seizures are divided into two categories known as simple and complex. A febrile seizure would be categorized as complex if it has occurred within 24 hours of another seizure or if it lasts longer than 15 minutes. A febrile seizure lasting less than 15 minutes would be considered simple. Sometimes modest hyperthermic stressors like physical exertion or a hot bath can provoke seizures in affected individuals. However, any seizure uninterrupted after 5 minutes, without a resumption of postictal (more normal; recovery-type; after-seizure) consciousness can lead to potentially fatal status epilepticus.","['HP:0000466', 'HP:0000708', 'HP:0000729', 'HP:0000736', 'HP:0000739', 'HP:0000980', 'HP:0000992', 'HP:0001250', 'HP:0001251', 'HP:0001252', 'HP:0001263', 'HP:0001268', 'HP:0001270', 'HP:0001300', 'HP:0001327', 'HP:0001336', 'HP:0001337', 'HP:0001763', 'HP:0002059', 'HP:0002063', 'HP:0002067', 'HP:0002121', 'HP:0002123', 'HP:0002133', 'HP:0002197', 'HP:0002266', 'HP:0002283', 'HP:0002307', 'HP:0002311', 'HP:0002345', 'HP:0002349', 'HP:0002353', 'HP:0002373', 'HP:0002376', 'HP:0002384', 'HP:0002396', 'HP:0003066', 'HP:0005484', 'HP:0006813', 'HP:0007010', 'HP:0007207', 'HP:0007240', 'HP:0007270', 'HP:0007334', 'HP:0007359', 'HP:0008081', 'HP:0008770', 'HP:0008947', 'HP:0010818', 'HP:0010841', 'HP:0011151', 'HP:0011169', 'HP:0011172', 'HP:0011182', 'HP:0011185', 'HP:0011198', 'HP:0011468', 'HP:0012758', 'HP:0012847', 'HP:0025101', 'HP:0025356', 'HP:0031475', 'HP:0100543', 'HP:0100694', 'HP:0100704', 'HP:0100710', 'HP:0200048', 'HP:0200134']"

310200,Duchenne muscular dystrophy,"DMD causes progressive muscle weakness due to muscle fiber disarray, death, and replacement with connective tissue or fat. The voluntary muscles are affected first, especially those of the hips, pelvic area, thighs, calves. It eventually progresses to the shoulders and neck, followed by arms, respiratory muscles, and other areas. Fatigue is common.Signs usually appear before age five, and may even be observed from the moment a boy takes his first steps. There is general difficulty with motor skills, which can result in an awkward manner of walking, stepping, or running. They tend to walk on their toes, in part due to shortening of the Achilles tendon, and because it compensates for knee extensor weakness. Falls can be frequent. It becomes harder and harder for the boy to walk; his ability to walk usually completely disintegrates before age 13. Most men affected with DMD become essentially “paralyzed from the neck down” by the age of 21. Cardiomyopathy, particularly dilated cardiomyopathy, is common, seen in half of 18-year-olds. The development of congestive heart failure or arrhythmia (irregular heartbeat) is only occasional. In late stages of the disease, respiratory impairment and swallowing impairment can occur, which can result in pneumonia.

A classic sign of DMD is trouble getting up from lying or sitting position, as manifested by a positive Gowers' sign. When a child tries to arise from lying on his stomach, he compensates for pelvic muscle weakness through use of the upper extremities: first by rising to stand on his arms and knees, and then ""walking"" his hands up his legs to stand upright. Another characteristic sign of DMD is pseudohypertrophy (enlarging) of the muscles of the tongue, calves, buttocks, and shoulders (around age 4 or 5). The muscle tissue is eventually replaced by fat and connective tissue, hence the term pseudohypertrophy. Muscle fiber deformities and muscle contractures of Achilles tendon and hamstrings can occur, which impair functionality because the muscle fibers shorten and fibrose in connective tissue. Skeletal deformities can occur, such as lumbar hyperlordosis, scoliosis, anterior pelvic tilt, and chest deformities. Lumbar hyperlordosis is thought to be compensatory mechanism in response to gluteal and quadricep muscle weakness, all of which cause altered posture and gait (eg: restricted hip extension).Non musculoskeletal manifestations of DMD occur. There is a higher risk of neurobehavioral disorders (e.g., ADHD), learning disorders (dyslexia), and non-progressive weaknesses in specific cognitive skills (in particular short-term verbal memory), which are believed to be the result of absent or dysfunctional dystrophin in the brain.","['HP:0000750', 'HP:0001252', 'HP:0001256', 'HP:0001263', 'HP:0001265', 'HP:0001270', 'HP:0001290', 'HP:0001328', 'HP:0001371', 'HP:0001635', 'HP:0001638', 'HP:0001644', 'HP:0002093', 'HP:0002515', 'HP:0002650', 'HP:0002791', 'HP:0002878', 'HP:0003115', 'HP:0003202', 'HP:0003236', 'HP:0003307', 'HP:0003323', 'HP:0003391', 'HP:0003560', 'HP:0003701', 'HP:0003707', 'HP:0008981', 'HP:0011675', 'HP:0100543']"

Autonomic crises - In children with FD, recurrent episodes of vomiting may occur. Such episodes may be triggered by physical (e.g. infection) or emotional stress, may occur every 15–20 minutes for over 24 hours, and may be accompanied with: significant hypertension, drenching sweat, breathing isssues, fever, tachycardia, aspiration pneumonia, skin blotches, drooling, and negative personality change.
Pain insensitivity - Insensitivity or indiference to painful stimuli may lead to frequent/progressive self-mutilation, burns, and ulcers. There may be self-mutilation of the tongue (especially in toddlers during teething), lips, and cheeks, or loss of teeth. Compulsive oral bitting may result in ulcers, or tumour-like masses (Riga-Fede disease).","['HP:0000077', 'HP:0000083', 'HP:0000096', 'HP:0000224', 'HP:0000495', 'HP:0000522', 'HP:0000545', 'HP:0000615', 'HP:0000648', 'HP:0000708', 'HP:0000712', 'HP:0000822', 'HP:0000966', 'HP:0000975', 'HP:0001063', 'HP:0001069', 'HP:0001100', 'HP:0001250', 'HP:0001251', 'HP:0001252', 'HP:0001265', 'HP:0001278', 'HP:0001288', 'HP:0001290', 'HP:0001510', 'HP:0001649', 'HP:0001954', 'HP:0002013', 'HP:0002014', 'HP:0002019', 'HP:0002020', 'HP:0002047', 'HP:0002103', 'HP:0002205', 'HP:0002311', 'HP:0002585', 'HP:0002650', 'HP:0002757', 'HP:0002797', 'HP:0002821', 'HP:0002902', 'HP:0003138', 'HP:0003259', 'HP:0003387', 'HP:0003457', 'HP:0004891', 'HP:0005947', 'HP:0007328', 'HP:0007957', 'HP:0008000', 'HP:0008872', 'HP:0009830', 'HP:0010885', 'HP:0012211', 'HP:0012804', 'HP:0100820', 'HP:0200020']"

133239,Esophageal cancer,"Prominent symptoms usually do not appear until the cancer has infiltrated over 60% of the circumference of the esophageal tube, by which time the tumor is already in an advanced stage. Onset of symptoms is usually caused by narrowing of the tube due to the physical presence of the tumor.The first and the most common symptom is usually difficulty in swallowing, which is often experienced first with solid foods and later with softer foods and liquids. Pain when swallowing is less usual at first. Weight loss is often an initial symptom in cases of squamous-cell carcinoma, though not usually in cases of adenocarcinoma. Eventual weight loss due to reduced appetite and undernutrition is common. Pain behind the breastbone or in the region around the stomach  often feels like heartburn. The pain can frequently be severe, worsening when food of any sort is swallowed. Another sign may be an unusually husky, raspy, or hoarse-sounding cough, a result of the tumor affecting the recurrent laryngeal nerve.
The presence of the tumor may disrupt the normal contractions of the esophagus when swallowing. This can lead to nausea and vomiting, regurgitation of food and coughing. There is also an increased risk of aspiration pneumonia due to food entering the airways through the abnormal connections (fistulas) that may develop between the esophagus and the trachea (windpipe). Early signs of this serious complication may be coughing on drinking or eating. The tumor surface may be fragile and bleed, causing vomiting of blood. Compression of local structures occurs in advanced disease, leading to such problems as upper airway obstruction and superior vena cava syndrome. Hypercalcemia (excess calcium in the blood) may occur.If the cancer has spread elsewhere, symptoms related to metastatic disease may appear. Common sites of spread include nearby lymph nodes, the liver, lungs and bone.  Liver metastasis can cause jaundice and abdominal swelling (ascites). Lung metastasis can cause, among other symptoms, impaired breathing due to excess fluid around the lungs (pleural effusion), and dyspnea (the feelings often associated with impaired breathing).","['HP:0002664', 'HP:0002860']"

The body's network of blood vessels is also affected. Children with this disorder may experience rashes of tiny red spots (petechiae) caused by bleeding under the skin and blue discoloration in the hands and feet due to reduced oxygen in the blood (acrocyanosis). Chronic diarrhea is another common feature of ethylmalonic encephalopathy.  EE is often identified by urine organic acid analysis, the excretion of ethylmalonic acid, methylsuccinic acid, isobutyrylglycine and isovalerylglucine.  Patients will also often have elevated thiosulphate concentration in their urine.The signs and symptoms of ethylmalonic encephalopathy are apparent at birth or begin in the first few months of life. Problems with the nervous system typically worsen over time, and most affected individuals survive only into early childhood. A few children with a milder, chronic form of this disorder have been reported, and there can be considerable phenotypic variation, even within families.  The life expectancy of individuals with EE is less than ten years.","['HP:0000967', 'HP:0001063', 'HP:0001249', 'HP:0001250', 'HP:0001251', 'HP:0001252', 'HP:0001263', 'HP:0001290', 'HP:0001298', 'HP:0001508', 'HP:0001626', 'HP:0002014', 'HP:0002028', 'HP:0002071', 'HP:0002376', 'HP:0003128', 'HP:0003219', 'HP:0003688', 'HP:0007183', 'HP:0007256', 'HP:0008046', 'HP:0012747', 'HP:0012751', 'HP:0012758', 'HP:0012841']"

Rarely, it can develop in the vagina.Signs and symptoms include intermittent fevers, anemia, leukocytosis, increased sedimentation rate, and other symptoms of inflammatory systemic illness.According to the Bone Cancer Research Trust (BCRT), the most common symptoms are localized pain, swelling, and sporadic bone pain with variable intensity.  The swelling is most likely to be visible if the sarcoma is located on a bone near the surface of the body, but when it occurs in other places deeper in the body, like on the pelvis, it may not be visible.",['HP:0012254']

208150,Fetal akinesia deformation sequence,"Often,  every joint in a patient with arthrogryposis is  affected; in 84% all limbs are involved, in 11% only the legs, and in 4% only the arms are involved. Every joint in the body, when affected, displays typical signs and symptoms:  for example, the shoulder (internal rotation); wrist (volar and ulnar); hand (fingers in fixed flexion and thumb in palm); hip (flexed, abducted and externally rotated, frequently dislocated); elbow (extension and pronation) and foot clubfoot and less commonly congenital vertical talus .  Range of motion can be different between joints because of the different deviations. Some types of arthrogryposis like amyoplasia have a symmetrical joint/limb involvement, with normal sensations. The contractures in the joints can  result in delayed  walking development in the first 5 years, but severity of contractures do not necessarily predict eventual walking ability or inability.Intelligence is normal to above normal in children with amyoplasia, but it is not known how many of these children have an above normal intelligence, and there is no literature available about the cause of this syndrome. There are a few syndromes like the Freeman-Sheldon and Gordon syndrome, which have craniofacial involvement. The amyoplasia form of arthrogryposis is sometimes accompanied with a midline facial hemangioma.
Arthrogryposis is not a diagnosis but a clinical finding, so this disease is often accompanied with other syndromes or diseases. These other diagnoses could affect any organ in a patient. There are a few slightly more common diagnoses such as pulmonary hypoplasia, cryptorchidism, congenital heart defects, tracheoesophageal fistulas, inguinal hernias, cleft palate, and eye abnormalities.",[]
135100,Fibrodysplasia ossificans progressiva,"For unknown reasons, children born with FOP often have malformed big toes, sometimes missing a joint or, in other cases, simply presenting with a notable lump at the minor joint. The first ""flare-up"" that leads to the formation of FOP bone usually occurs before the age of 10. The bone growth generally progresses from the top of the body downward, just as bones grow in fetuses. A child with FOP will typically develop additional bones starting at the neck, then at the shoulders, arms, chest area, and finally at the feet.
Specifically, ossification is typically first seen in the dorsal, axial, cranial and proximal regions of the body. Later the disease progresses in the ventral, appendicular, caudal and distal regions of the body. However, it does not necessarily occur in this order due to injury-caused flare-ups. Often, the tumor-like lumps that characterize a flare-up of the disease appear suddenly. 
Bone growth occurring during flare-ups may result in the loss of mobility to affected joints, including, if the jaw/mandible is involved, the inability to fully open the mouth, limiting speech and eating. A specific occurrence of a flare-up of this condition in the foot/ankle joints can result in the limited ability to put a foot flat on the ground. Bone growth can also result in the immobilization of the hip or knee, affecting the individual's ability to walk. Extra bone formation around the rib cage restricts the expansion of lungs and diaphragm causing respiratory complications.
Since the disorder is so rare, the condition may be misdiagnosed as cancer or fibrosis. This leads physicians to order biopsies which can exacerbate the growth of FOP bone. The presence of malformed toes or thumbs in those born with FOP help distinguish this disorder from other skeletal problems.With proper medical management the median age of survival is 40 years. However, delayed diagnosis, trauma, and infections can decrease life expectancy.","['HP:0000365', 'HP:0000405', 'HP:0000407', 'HP:0000501', 'HP:0000687', 'HP:0001006', 'HP:0001249', 'HP:0001250', 'HP:0001256', 'HP:0001376', 'HP:0001482', 'HP:0001508', 'HP:0001596', 'HP:0001822', 'HP:0001903', 'HP:0002093', 'HP:0002135', 'HP:0002650', 'HP:0002878', 'HP:0003016', 'HP:0003306', 'HP:0003468', 'HP:0004209', 'HP:0004629', 'HP:0006429', 'HP:0008449', 'HP:0010034', 'HP:0010054', 'HP:0010058', 'HP:0010109', 'HP:0010566', 'HP:0011987', 'HP:0011988', 'HP:0011989', 'HP:0100240']"

Less common symptoms include atherosclerosis, hepatomegaly (enlarged liver), splenomegaly (enlarged spleen), and enlarged lymph nodes.Fish-eye disease is less severe and most commonly presents with impaired vision due to corneal opacification. It rarely presents with other findings, although, atherosclerosis, hepatomegaly, splenomegaly, and lymphadenopathy can occur. Carlson and Philipson found that the disease was named so because the cornea of the eye was so opaque or cloudy with dots of cholesterol that it resembled a boiled fish.If an individual only carries one copy of the mutated gene, they typically do not show symptoms.","['HP:0000505', 'HP:0001681', 'HP:0001744', 'HP:0002155', 'HP:0002240', 'HP:0002621', 'HP:0002716', 'HP:0003141', 'HP:0003233', 'HP:0003362', 'HP:0007759', 'HP:0007957']"

300624,Fragile X syndrome,"Most young children do not show any physical signs of FXS. It is not until puberty that physical features of FXS begin to develop. Aside from intellectual disability, prominent characteristics of the syndrome may include an elongated face, large or protruding ears, flat feet, larger testes (macroorchidism), and low muscle tone. Recurrent otitis media (middle ear infection) and sinusitis is common during early childhood. Speech may be cluttered or nervous. Behavioral characteristics may include stereotypic movements (e.g., hand-flapping) and atypical social development, particularly shyness, limited eye contact, memory problems, and difficulty with face encoding. Some individuals with fragile X syndrome also meet the diagnostic criteria for autism.
Males with a full mutation display virtually complete penetrance and will therefore almost always display symptoms of FXS, while females with a full mutation generally display a penetrance of about 50% as a result of having a second, normal X chromosome. Females with FXS may have symptoms ranging from mild to severe, although they are generally less affected than males.","['HP:0000053', 'HP:0000246', 'HP:0000256', 'HP:0000275', 'HP:0000276', 'HP:0000280', 'HP:0000303', 'HP:0000388', 'HP:0000389', 'HP:0000400', 'HP:0000411', 'HP:0000486', 'HP:0000717', 'HP:0000739', 'HP:0000752', 'HP:0000767', 'HP:0000817', 'HP:0001250', 'HP:0001252', 'HP:0001388', 'HP:0001634', 'HP:0001763', 'HP:0002003', 'HP:0002007', 'HP:0002020', 'HP:0002050', 'HP:0002120', 'HP:0002167', 'HP:0002342', 'HP:0002457', 'HP:0002650', 'HP:0003564', 'HP:0004970', 'HP:0007018', 'HP:0007165', 'HP:0008640', 'HP:0100716']"

229300,Friedreich's ataxia,"Symptoms typically start between the ages of 5 and 15, but in Late Onset FRDA they may occur after age 25 years. The progressive loss of coordination and muscle strength leads to loss of ambulation and the full-time use of a wheelchair. Most young people diagnosed with FRDA require mobility aids such as a cane, walker, or wheelchair by their childhood or early 20s.
The disease is progressive with increasing staggering or stumbling gait and frequent falling. Lower extremities are more severely involved. On average, after 10–15 years, people lose the ability to stand or walk without assistance. However, disease progression is variable, and people may be able to walk decades after onset, while others require a wheelchair within a few years.Symptoms may include the following:

91% of people develop heart problems such as cardiomegaly (up to dilated cardiomyopathy), symmetrical hypertrophy, heart murmurs, atrial fibrillation, tachycardia (fast heart rate), hypertrophic cardiomyopathy and conduction defects
Cerebellar: nystagmus, fast saccadic eye movements, dysmetria, loss of coordination (truncal ataxia and Stomping gait)
Vision impairment
Hearing impairment
Slurred speech
Abnormal curvature of the spine
Dorsal column: Loss of vibratory sensation and proprioceptive sensation occurs

Symptomatic individuals present with symptoms identical to those of patients who are on thiazide diuretics, given that the affected transporter is the exact target of thiazides, (unlike in Bartter syndrome, in which patients present as though on loop diuretics).
Clinical signs of Gitelman syndrome include a high blood pH in combination with low levels of chloride, potassium, and magnesium in the blood and decreased calcium excretion in the urine. In contrast to people with Gordon's syndrome, those affected by Gitelman syndrome generally have low or normal blood pressure. Individuals affected by Gitelman syndrome often complain of severe muscle cramps or weakness, numbness, thirst, waking up at night to urinate, salt cravings, abnormal sensations, chondrocalcinosis, or weakness expressed as extreme fatigue or irritability. Though cravings for salt are most common and severe, cravings for sour foods (e.g. vinegar, lemons, and sour figs) have been noted in some persons affected. More severe symptoms such as seizures, tetany, and paralysis have been reported. Abnormal heart rhythms and a prolonged QT interval can be detected on electrocardiogram and cases of sudden cardiac death have been reported due to low potassium levels.

140700,Heinz body anemia,"Anemia goes undetected in many people and symptoms can be minor. The symptoms can be related to an underlying cause or the anemia itself.
Most commonly, people with anemia report feelings of weakness or fatigue, and sometimes poor concentration. They may also report shortness of breath on exertion.  In very severe anemia, the body may compensate for the lack of oxygen-carrying capability of the blood by increasing cardiac output.  The patient may have symptoms related to this, such as palpitations, angina (if pre-existing heart disease is present), intermittent claudication of the legs, and symptoms of heart failure.
On examination, the signs exhibited may include pallor (pale skin, lining mucosa, conjunctiva and nail beds), but this is not a reliable sign. A blue coloration of the sclera may be noticed in some cases of iron-deficiency anemia. There may be signs of specific causes of anemia, e.g., koilonychia (in iron deficiency), jaundice (when anemia results from abnormal break down of red blood cells – in hemolytic anemia), bone deformities (found in thalassemia major) or leg ulcers (seen in sickle-cell disease).
In severe anemia, there may be signs of a hyperdynamic circulation: tachycardia (a fast heart rate), bounding pulse, flow murmurs, and cardiac ventricular hypertrophy (enlargement).  There may be signs of heart failure.
Pica, the consumption of non-food items such as ice, but also paper, wax, or grass, and even hair or dirt, may be a symptom of iron deficiency, although it occurs often in those who have normal levels of hemoglobin.
Chronic anemia may result in behavioral disturbances in children as a direct result of impaired neurological development in infants, and reduced academic performance in children of school age. Restless legs syndrome is more common in people with iron-deficiency anemia than in the general population.","['HP:0001930', 'HP:0001939', 'HP:0005511', 'HP:0020082']"

FHM can also present with the same signs as benign familial infantile convulsions and alternating hemiplegia of childhood. Other symptoms are altered consciousness (in fact, some cases seem related to head trauma), gaze-evoked nystagmus, and coma. Aura symptoms, such as numbness and blurring of vision, typically persist for 30–60 minutes, but can last for weeks to months. An attack resembles a stroke, but unlike a stroke, it resolves in time.

Lymphadenopathy: the most common symptom of Hodgkin is the painless enlargement of one or more lymph nodes. The nodes may also feel rubbery and swollen when examined. The nodes of the neck and shoulders (cervical and supraclavicular) are most frequently involved (80–90% of the time, on average). The lymph nodes of the chest are often affected, and these may be noticed on a chest radiograph.
Systemic symptoms: about one-third of people with Hodgkin disease may also present with systemic symptoms, including:Itchy skin
Night sweats.
Unexplained weight loss of at least 10% of the person's total body mass in six months or less.
Low-grade fever.
Fatigue (lassitude).
Systemic symptoms such as fever, night sweats, and weight loss are known as B symptoms; thus, presence of these indicate that the person's stage is, for example, 2B instead of 2A.
Splenomegaly: enlargement of the spleen is often present in people with Hodgkin lymphoma. The enlargement, however, is seldom massive, and the size of the spleen may fluctuate during the course of treatment.
Hepatomegaly: enlargement of the liver, due to liver involvement, is infrequent in people with Hodgkin Lymphoma.
Hepatosplenomegaly: the enlargement of both the liver and spleen caused by the same disease.
Pain following alcohol consumption: classically, involved nodes are painful after alcohol consumption, though this phenomenon is very uncommon, occurring in only two to three percent of people with Hodgkin lymphoma, thus having a low sensitivity. On the other hand, its positive predictive value is high enough for it to be regarded as a pathognomonic sign of Hodgkin lymphoma. The pain typically has an onset within minutes after ingesting alcohol, and is usually felt as coming from the vicinity where there is an involved lymph node. The pain has been described as either sharp and stabbing or dull and aching.
Back pain: nonspecific back pain (pain that cannot be localised or its cause determined by examination or scanning techniques) has been reported in some cases of Hodgkin lymphoma. The lower back is most often affected.
Cyclical fever: people may also present with a cyclical high-grade fever known as the Pel–Ebstein fever, or more simply ""P-E fever"". However, there is debate as to whether the P-E fever truly exists.
Nephrotic syndrome can occur in individuals with Hodgkin lymphoma and is most commonly caused by minimal change disease.","['HP:0000975', 'HP:0000988', 'HP:0000989', 'HP:0001251', 'HP:0001744', 'HP:0001824', 'HP:0001945', 'HP:0002039', 'HP:0002076', 'HP:0002093', 'HP:0002105', 'HP:0002240', 'HP:0002653', 'HP:0002664', 'HP:0002665', 'HP:0002716', 'HP:0002797', 'HP:0003347', 'HP:0003459', 'HP:0004396', 'HP:0005374', 'HP:0005528', 'HP:0009830', 'HP:0012189', 'HP:0012378', 'HP:0012735', 'HP:0100749']"

143100,Huntington's disease,"Symptoms of Huntington's disease most commonly become noticeable between the ages of 30 and 50 years, but they can begin at any age. In the early stages, there are subtle changes in personality, cognition, and physical skills. The physical symptoms are usually the first to be noticed, as cognitive and behavioral symptoms are generally not severe enough to be recognized on their own at the earlier stages. Almost everyone with HD eventually exhibits similar physical symptoms, but the onset, progression and extent of cognitive and behavioral symptoms vary significantly between individuals.The most characteristic initial physical symptoms are jerky, random, and uncontrollable movements called chorea. Chorea may be initially exhibited as general restlessness, small unintentionally initiated or uncompleted motions, lack of coordination, or slowed saccadic eye movements. These minor motor abnormalities usually precede more obvious signs of motor dysfunction by at least three years. The clear appearance of symptoms such as rigidity, writhing motions or abnormal posturing appear as the disorder progresses. These are signs that the system in the brain that is responsible for movement has been affected. Psychomotor functions become increasingly impaired, such that any action that requires muscle control is affected. Common consequences are physical instability, abnormal facial expression, and difficulties chewing, swallowing, and speaking. Eating difficulties commonly cause weight loss and may lead to malnutrition. Sleep disturbances are also associated symptoms. Juvenile HD differs from these symptoms in that it generally progresses faster and chorea is exhibited briefly, if at all, with rigidity being the dominant symptom. Seizures are also a common symptom of this form of HD.Cognitive abilities are progressively impaired.  Especially affected are executive functions, which include planning, cognitive flexibility, abstract thinking, rule acquisition, initiation of appropriate actions, and inhibition of inappropriate actions. As the disease progresses, memory deficits tend to appear. Reported impairments range from short-term memory deficits to long-term memory difficulties, including deficits in episodic (memory of one's life), procedural (memory of the body of how to perform an activity) and working memory. Cognitive problems tend to worsen over time, ultimately leading to dementia. This pattern of deficits has been called a subcortical dementia syndrome to distinguish it from the typical effects of cortical dementias e.g. Alzheimer's disease.Reported neuropsychiatric manifestations are anxiety, depression, a reduced display of emotions, egocentrism, aggression, and compulsive behavior, the latter of which can cause or worsen addictions, including alcoholism, gambling, and hypersexuality. Difficulties in recognizing other people's negative expressions have also been observed. The prevalence of these symptoms is highly variable between studies, with estimated rates for lifetime prevalence of psychiatric disorders between 33% and 76%. For many sufferers and their families, these symptoms are among the most distressing aspects of the disease, often affecting daily functioning and constituting reason for institutionalization. Suicidal thoughts and suicide attempts are more common than in the general population. Often individuals have reduced awareness of chorea, cognitive and emotional impairments.Mutant huntingtin is expressed throughout the body and associated with abnormalities in peripheral tissues that are directly caused by such expression outside the brain. These abnormalities include muscle atrophy, cardiac failure, impaired glucose tolerance, weight loss, osteoporosis, and testicular atrophy.","['HP:0000496', 'HP:0000708', 'HP:0000716', 'HP:0000726', 'HP:0000751', 'HP:0001250', 'HP:0001257', 'HP:0001272', 'HP:0001347', 'HP:0001608', 'HP:0002063', 'HP:0002066', 'HP:0002067', 'HP:0002072', 'HP:0002120', 'HP:0002171', 'HP:0002353', 'HP:0002376', 'HP:0002529', 'HP:0100022']"
176670,Hutchinson–Gilford progeria syndrome,"Children with progeria usually develop the first symptoms during their first few months of life. The earliest symptoms may include a failure to thrive and a localized scleroderma-like skin condition. As a child ages past infancy, additional conditions become apparent usually around 18–24 months. Limited growth, full-body alopecia (hair loss), and a distinctive appearance (a small face with a shallow recessed jaw, and a pinched nose) are all characteristics of progeria. Signs and symptoms of this progressive disease tend to become more marked as the child ages. Later, the condition causes wrinkled skin, atherosclerosis, kidney failure, loss of eyesight, and cardiovascular problems. Scleroderma, a hardening and tightening of the skin on trunk and extremities of the body, is prevalent. People diagnosed with this disorder usually have small, fragile bodies, like those of elderly people. The head is usually large in relation to the body, with a narrow, wrinkled face and a beak nose. Prominent scalp veins are noticeable (made more obvious by alopecia), as well as prominent eyes. Musculoskeletal degeneration causes loss of body fat and muscle, stiff joints, hip dislocations, and other symptoms generally absent in the non-elderly population. Individuals usually retain typical mental and motor development.","['HP:0000044', 'HP:0000160', 'HP:0000233', 'HP:0000272', 'HP:0000320', 'HP:0000347', 'HP:0000400', 'HP:0000407', 'HP:0000518', 'HP:0000520', 'HP:0000535', 'HP:0000540', 'HP:0000561', 'HP:0000668', 'HP:0000678', 'HP:0000684', 'HP:0000726', 'HP:0000765', 'HP:0000789', 'HP:0000822', 'HP:0000823', 'HP:0000842', 'HP:0000877', 'HP:0000883', 'HP:0000894', 'HP:0000938', 'HP:0000939', 'HP:0000956', 'HP:0000961', 'HP:0000963', 'HP:0000966', 'HP:0001006', 'HP:0001043', 'HP:0001084', 'HP:0001097', 'HP:0001249', 'HP:0001297', 'HP:0001387', 'HP:0001397', 'HP:0001508', 'HP:0001510', 'HP:0001596', 'HP:0001611', 'HP:0001620', 'HP:0001635', 'HP:0001657', 'HP:0001658', 'HP:0001681', 'HP:0001712', 'HP:0001816', 'HP:0001894', 'HP:0002136', 'HP:0002155', 'HP:0002164', 'HP:0002216', 'HP:0002326', 'HP:0002557', 'HP:0002664', 'HP:0002692', 'HP:0002753', 'HP:0002758', 'HP:0002797', 'HP:0002808', 'HP:0002827', 'HP:0002828', 'HP:0002905', 'HP:0003016', 'HP:0003115', 'HP:0003300', 'HP:0003355', 'HP:0004322', 'HP:0004325', 'HP:0004416', 'HP:0004417', 'HP:0004492', 'HP:0004931', 'HP:0005181', 'HP:0005461', 'HP:0006224', 'HP:0006660', 'HP:0007427', 'HP:0007485', 'HP:0008070', 'HP:0008151', 'HP:0008197', 'HP:0008214', 'HP:0009906', 'HP:0010665', 'HP:0011220', 'HP:0011356', 'HP:0011703', 'HP:0011800', 'HP:0011832', 'HP:0040113', 'HP:0040160', 'HP:0040171', 'HP:0100546', 'HP:0100578', 'HP:0100671', 'HP:0100679']"

Other common defects include incomplete lung development, heart defects, a cleft lip or palate, polydactyly, and an abnormally small jaw. Stillbirth and an excess of amniotic fluid (polyhydramnios) are common during pregnancy with a HLS-affected foetus, with cases of up to 8 litres cited compared to the normal 1 litre.

Ichthyosis bullosa of Siemens affects only the upper layers of the epidermis whilst epidermolytic hyperkeratosis affects the suprabasal layer which is deeper in the skin.At birth the baby's skin has a red appearance like a sun burn (erythema). Blistering is usually present at birth and may be extensive or localized depending on the severity of the disease.Over the first few weeks the redness disappears and is replaced by dry, flaking skin on the arms, legs and around the belly button. Other areas of skin appear normal. The skin is fragile and is prone to blistering (caused by mild trauma or sweating). After a few months hyperkeratosis develops with a dark grey or brown, ridged appearance on the ankles, knees and elbows. Palms and soles are generally unaffected. A slightly unpleasant, sweet odour may be present.A distinctive characteristic of ichthyosis bullosa of Siemens that is not present in other forms of ichthyosis is called the ""Mauserung phenomenon"" (Mauserung is German for ""moulting"" and was first described by H.W.Siemens). These are small patches of bare, apparently normal skin in the middle of areas of hyperkeratosis.As the sufferer ages the flaking and blistering should improve. The hyperkeratosis may grow more severe but more localized and is generally only present on flexural folds of the major joints.","['HP:0000963', 'HP:0000969', 'HP:0000982', 'HP:0007475', 'HP:0008064', 'HP:0008066', 'HP:0010783', 'HP:0100792']"

148300,Keratoconus,"People with early keratoconus typically notice a minor blurring of their vision and come to their clinician seeking corrective lenses for reading or driving. At early stages, the symptoms of keratoconus may be no different from those of any other refractive defect of the eye. As the disease progresses, vision deteriorates, sometimes rapidly due to irregular astigmatism. Visual acuity becomes impaired at all distances, and night vision is often poor. Some individuals have vision in one eye that is markedly worse than that in the other. The disease is often bilateral, though asymmetrical. Some develop photophobia (sensitivity to bright light), eye strain from squinting in order to read, or itching in the eye, but there is normally little or no sensation of pain. It may cause luminous objects to appear as cylindrical pipes with the same intensity at all points.

The classic symptom of keratoconus is the perception of multiple ""ghost"" images, known as monocular polyopia. This effect is most clearly seen with a high contrast field, such as a point of light on a dark background. Instead of seeing just one point, a person with keratoconus sees many images of the point, spread out in a chaotic pattern. This pattern does not typically change from day to day, but over time, it often takes on new forms. People also commonly notice streaking and flaring distortion around light sources. Some even notice the images moving relative to one another in time with their heart beat.
The predominant optical aberration of the eye in keratoconus is coma. The visual distortion experienced by the person comes from two sources, one being the irregular deformation of the surface of the cornea, and the other being scarring that occurs on its exposed highpoints. These factors act to form regions on the cornea that map an image to different locations on the retina. The effect can worsen in low light conditions, as the dark-adapted pupil dilates to expose more of the irregular surface of the cornea.","['HP:0000483', 'HP:0000563']"

Symptoms include irritability, fevers, limb stiffness, seizures, feeding difficulties (like GERD), vomiting, staring episodes, and slowing of mental and motor development. In the first stages of the disease, doctors often mistake the symptoms for those of cerebral palsy. Other symptoms include muscle weakness, spasticity, deafness, optic atrophy, optic nerve enlargement, blindness, paralysis, and difficulty when swallowing. Prolonged weight loss may also occur.
10–15% of individuals with later-onset Krabbe disease have a much slower disease progression.

256000,Leigh syndrome,"The symptoms of Leigh syndrome are classically described as beginning in infancy and leading to death within a span of several years; however, as more cases are recognized, it is apparent that symptoms can emerge at any age—including adolescence or adulthood—and patients can survive for many years following diagnosis. Symptoms are often first seen after a triggering event that taxes the body's energy production, such as an infection or surgery. The general course of Leigh syndrome is one of episodic developmental regression during times of metabolic stress. Some patients have long periods without disease progression while others develop progressive decline.Infants with the syndrome have symptoms that include diarrhea, vomiting, and dysphagia (trouble swallowing or sucking), leading to a failure to thrive. Children with early Leigh disease also may appear irritable and cry much more than healthy babies. Seizures are often seen. Excess lactate may be seen in the urine, cerebrospinal fluid, and blood of a person with Leigh syndrome.As the disease progresses, the muscular system is debilitated throughout the body, as the brain cannot control the contraction of muscles. Hypotonia (low muscle tone and strength), dystonia (involuntary, sustained muscle contraction), and ataxia (lack of control over movement) are often seen in people with Leigh disease. The eyes are particularly affected; the muscles that control the eyes become weak, paralyzed, or uncontrollable in conditions called ophthalmoparesis (weakness or paralysis) and nystagmus (involuntary eye movements). Slow saccades are also sometimes seen. The heart and lungs can also fail as a result of Leigh disease. Hypertrophic cardiomyopathy (thickening of part of the heart muscle) is also sometimes found and can cause death; asymmetric septal hypertrophy has also been associated with Leigh syndrome. In children with Leigh-syndrome associated ventricular septal defects, caused by pyruvate dehydrogenase deficiency, high forehead and large ears are seen; facial abnormalities are not typical of Leigh syndrome.However, respiratory failure is the most common cause of death in people with Leigh syndrome. Other neurological symptoms include peripheral neuropathy, loss of sensation in extremities caused by damage to the peripheral nervous system.Hypertrichosis is seen in Leigh syndrome caused by mutations in the nuclear gene SURF1.","['HP:0000407', 'HP:0000486', 'HP:0000508', 'HP:0000580', 'HP:0000602', 'HP:0000639', 'HP:0000648', 'HP:0000712', 'HP:0000998', 'HP:0001249', 'HP:0001250', 'HP:0001251', 'HP:0001252', 'HP:0001257', 'HP:0001260', 'HP:0001263', 'HP:0001290', 'HP:0001332', 'HP:0001347', 'HP:0001404', 'HP:0001508', 'HP:0002093', 'HP:0002151', 'HP:0002171', 'HP:0002490', 'HP:0002793', 'HP:0002878', 'HP:0003128', 'HP:0004374', 'HP:0007020', 'HP:0007305', 'HP:0007650', 'HP:0008972', 'HP:0025356', 'HP:0100022', 'HP:0100543']"
151100,Leopard syndrome,"An alternative name of the condition, LEOPARD syndrome, is a mnemonic, originally coined in 1969, as the condition is characterized by some of the following seven conditions, the first letters of which spell LEOPARD, along with the characteristic ""freckling"" of the skin, caused by the lentigines that is reminiscent of the large cat.

Lentigines — Reddish-brown to dark brown macules (surface skin lesion) generally occurring in a high number (10,000+) over a large portion of the skin, at times higher than 80% coverage. These can even appear inside the mouth (buccal), or on the surface of the eye (scleral). These have irregular borders and range in size from 1 mm in diameter to café-au-lait spots, several centimeters in diameter. Also, some areas of vitiligo-like hypopigmentation may be observed.
Electrocardiographic conduction abnormalities: Generally observed on an electrocardiograph as a bundle branch block.
Ocular hypertelorism: Wideset eyes, which lead to a similar facial resemblance between patients. Facial abnormalities are the second highest occurring symptom after the lentigines. Abnormalities also include: broad nasal root, prognathism (protruding lower jaw), or low-set, possibly rotated, ears.
Pulmonary stenosis: Narrowing of the pulmonary artery as it exits the heart. Other cardiac abnormalities may be present, including aortic stenosis, or mitral valve prolapse.
Abnormal genitalia: usually cryptorchidism (retention of testicles in body) or monorchism (single testicle). In female patients, this presents as missing or single ovaries, much harder by nature to detect. Ultrasound imaging is performed at regular intervals, from the age of 1 year, to determine if ovaries are present.
Retarded growth: Slow, or stunted growth. Most newborns with this syndrome are of normal birth weight and length, but will often slow within the first year.
Deafness: Sensorineural (nerve deafness).The presence of all of these hallmarks is not needed for a diagnosis. A clinical diagnosis is considered made when, with lentigines present there are 2 other symptoms observed, such as ECG abnormalities and ocular hypertelorism, or without lentigines, 3 of the above conditions are present, with a first-degree relative (i.e. parent, child, sibling) with a clinical diagnosis.
Additional dermatologic abnormalities (axillary freckling, localized hypopigmentation, interdigital webbing, hyperelastic skin)
Mild mental retardation is observed in about 30% of those affected with the syndrome
Nystagmus (involuntary eye movements), seizures, or hyposmia (reduced ability to smell) has been documented in a few patients
In 2004, a patient was reported with recurrent upper extremity aneurysms that required surgical repairs.
In 2006, a NSML patient was reported with acute myelogenous leukemia.Due to the rarity of the syndrome itself, it is hard to determine whether certain additional diseases are actually part of the syndrome. With a base population of possibly less than one thousand individuals, one or two outlying cases can skew the statistical population very quickly.","['HP:0000028', 'HP:0000047', 'HP:0000054', 'HP:0000122', 'HP:0000175', 'HP:0000242', 'HP:0000286', 'HP:0000303', 'HP:0000316', 'HP:0000325', 'HP:0000358', 'HP:0000369', 'HP:0000407', 'HP:0000411', 'HP:0000457', 'HP:0000465', 'HP:0000470', 'HP:0000486', 'HP:0000508', 'HP:0000767', 'HP:0000768', 'HP:0000823', 'HP:0000921', 'HP:0000957', 'HP:0001003', 'HP:0001256', 'HP:0001639', 'HP:0001642', 'HP:0001682', 'HP:0001709', 'HP:0002751', 'HP:0002967', 'HP:0002996', 'HP:0003298', 'HP:0003691', 'HP:0004322', 'HP:0004409', 'HP:0008724', 'HP:0010463', 'HP:0011710', 'HP:0012569']"
246200,Leprechaunism,"Facial features indicative of Donohue syndrome include protuberant and low-set ears, flaring nostrils, unusually large mouth, thick lips, and widely spaced eyes. Physical features include stunted growth (including during gestation), lack of subcutaneous adipose tissue, muscle atrophy, hirsutism (excessive body hair growth), and dysplasia (nail malformation). Additionally, a condition known as acanthosis nigricans is present in affected individuals. In acanthosis nigricans, patches of skin darken and thicken to gain a velvet-like appearance. Gender specific features also include enlarged clitoris and breasts, as well as ovarian cysts in affected females, and enlarged penis in affected males. In the Journal of Pediatric Medicine, Donohue and Uchida described affected sisters whose growth appeared to have ended in the seventh month of gestation, both born alive but dying before four months of age. Very early death (or spontaneous abortion) is the norm, although sufferers sometimes live longer than a decade.Endocrine related abnormalities as a result of insulin receptor malfunction include insulin resistance, hypoglycemia and hyperglicemia (depending on whether or not the individual has eaten) and hyperinsulemia. 
A much milder form of the disease, in which there is some insulin resistance but normal growth and subcutaneous fat distribution, is also known. It is caused by a less severe mutation of the same gene.","['HP:0000028', 'HP:0000040', 'HP:0000065', 'HP:0000105', 'HP:0000121', 'HP:0000138', 'HP:0000154', 'HP:0000179', 'HP:0000212', 'HP:0000252', 'HP:0000274', 'HP:0000307', 'HP:0000316', 'HP:0000364', 'HP:0000368', 'HP:0000369', 'HP:0000400', 'HP:0000411', 'HP:0000445', 'HP:0000474', 'HP:0000520', 'HP:0000771', 'HP:0000826', 'HP:0000842', 'HP:0000848', 'HP:0000855', 'HP:0000859', 'HP:0000956', 'HP:0000962', 'HP:0000974', 'HP:0000998', 'HP:0001034', 'HP:0001072', 'HP:0001176', 'HP:0001249', 'HP:0001395', 'HP:0001396', 'HP:0001508', 'HP:0001511', 'HP:0001525', 'HP:0001537', 'HP:0001639', 'HP:0001833', 'HP:0001943', 'HP:0001999', 'HP:0002035', 'HP:0002150', 'HP:0002164', 'HP:0002205', 'HP:0002219', 'HP:0002230', 'HP:0002240', 'HP:0002705', 'HP:0002719', 'HP:0002750', 'HP:0002900', 'HP:0003074', 'HP:0003162', 'HP:0003202', 'HP:0003247', 'HP:0003270', 'HP:0003758', 'HP:0004298', 'HP:0004322', 'HP:0004325', 'HP:0004326', 'HP:0004405', 'HP:0004428', 'HP:0004510', 'HP:0004914', 'HP:0005280', 'HP:0005978', 'HP:0008665', 'HP:0008846', 'HP:0008872', 'HP:0008887', 'HP:0008897', 'HP:0008936', 'HP:0009928', 'HP:0010312', 'HP:0010458', 'HP:0011344', 'HP:0011787', 'HP:0011998', 'HP:0012471', 'HP:0025024', 'HP:0100543', 'HP:0100578', 'HP:0100879']"

A correlation between agenesis of the corpus callosum and intellectual disability in LFS, however, has not been suggested.","['HP:0000053', 'HP:0000119', 'HP:0000164', 'HP:0000194', 'HP:0000218', 'HP:0000219', 'HP:0000248', 'HP:0000256', 'HP:0000275', 'HP:0000276', 'HP:0000322', 'HP:0000327', 'HP:0000347', 'HP:0000348', 'HP:0000369', 'HP:0000411', 'HP:0000426', 'HP:0000446', 'HP:0000678', 'HP:0000708', 'HP:0000709', 'HP:0000712', 'HP:0000717', 'HP:0000718', 'HP:0000722', 'HP:0000735', 'HP:0000738', 'HP:0000744', 'HP:0000752', 'HP:0000767', 'HP:0001156', 'HP:0001166', 'HP:0001249', 'HP:0001250', 'HP:0001252', 'HP:0001274', 'HP:0001290', 'HP:0001371', 'HP:0001388', 'HP:0001519', 'HP:0001547', 'HP:0001608', 'HP:0001611', 'HP:0001629', 'HP:0001631', 'HP:0002002', 'HP:0002007', 'HP:0002167', 'HP:0002650', 'HP:0003189', 'HP:0004970', 'HP:0005692', 'HP:0007018', 'HP:0007370', 'HP:0008544', 'HP:0011220', 'HP:0011304', 'HP:0100490', 'HP:0100753']"
211980,Lung cancer,"Signs and symptoms which may suggest lung cancer include:
Respiratory symptoms: coughing, coughing up blood, wheezing, or shortness of breath
Systemic symptoms: weight loss, weakness, fever, or clubbing of the fingernails
Symptoms due to the cancer mass pressing on adjacent structures: chest pain, bone pain, superior vena cava obstruction, or difficulty swallowingIf the cancer grows in the airways, it may obstruct airflow, causing breathing difficulties. The obstruction can also lead to accumulation of secretions behind the blockage, and increase the risk of pneumonia.Depending on the type of tumor, paraneoplastic phenomena — symptoms not due to the local presence of cancer — may initially attract attention to the disease. In lung cancer, these phenomena may include hypercalcemia, syndrome of inappropriate antidiuretic hormone (SIADH, abnormally concentrated urine and diluted blood), ectopic ACTH production, or Lambert–Eaton myasthenic syndrome (muscle weakness due to autoantibodies). Tumors in the top of the lung, known as Pancoast tumors, may invade the local part of the sympathetic nervous system, resulting in Horner's syndrome (dropping of the eyelid and a small pupil on that side), as well as damage to the brachial plexus.Many of the symptoms of lung cancer (poor appetite, weight loss, fever, fatigue) are not specific. In many people, the cancer has already spread beyond the original site by the time they have symptoms and seek medical attention. Symptoms that suggest the presence of metastatic disease include weight loss, bone pain, and neurological symptoms (headaches, fainting, convulsions, or limb weakness). Common sites of spread include the brain, bone, adrenal glands, opposite lung, liver, pericardium, and kidneys. About 10% of people with lung cancer do not have symptoms at diagnosis; these cancers are incidentally found on routine chest radiography.","['HP:0002086', 'HP:0006519']"
606690,Lymphangioleiomyomatosis,"The average age of onset is the early to mid 30s. Exertional dyspnea (shortness of breath) and spontaneous pneumothorax (lung collapse) have been reported as the initial presentation of the disease in 49% and 46% of patients, respectively.Diagnosis is typically delayed 5 to 6 years. The condition is often misdiagnosed as asthma or chronic obstructive pulmonary disease. The first pneumothorax, or lung collapse, precedes the diagnosis of LAM in 82% of patients. The consensus clinical definition of LAM includes multiple symptoms:

Fatigue
Cough
Coughing up blood (rarely massive)
Chest pain
Chylous complications arising from lymphatic obstruction, including
Chylothorax
Chylous ascites
Chylopericardium
Chyloptysis
Chyluria
Chyle in vaginal discharge
Chyle in stool.
Angiomyolipomas (fatty kidney tumors) are present in about 30% of patients with sporadic LAM and up to 90% of patients with TSC-LAM. Angiomyolipomas can sometimes spontaneously bleed, causing pain or low blood pressure.
Cystic lymphangiomas or lymph nodes with hypodense centers, which mimic necrotizing lymphomas, ovarian or renal cancers, or other malignancies can occur in the retroperitoneum, pelvis or mediastinum.Lung destruction in LAM is a consequence of diffuse infiltration by neoplastic smooth muscle-like cells that invade all lung structures including the lymphatics, airway walls, blood vessels and interstitial spaces. The consequences of vessel and airway obstruction include chylous fluid accumulations, hemoptysis, airflow obstruction and pneumothorax. The typical disease course displays progressive dyspnea on exertion, spaced by recurrent pneumothoraces and in some patients, chylous pleural effusions or ascites.Most people have dyspnea on exertion with daily activities by 10 years after symptom onset. Many patients require supplemental oxygen over that interval.","['HP:0000008', 'HP:0000238', 'HP:0000648', 'HP:0000790', 'HP:0001000', 'HP:0001004', 'HP:0001250', 'HP:0001541', 'HP:0001945', 'HP:0002027', 'HP:0002091', 'HP:0002094', 'HP:0002097', 'HP:0002105', 'HP:0002107', 'HP:0002113', 'HP:0002205', 'HP:0002239', 'HP:0002716', 'HP:0005562', 'HP:0006772', 'HP:0009594', 'HP:0009721', 'HP:0009726', 'HP:0010310', 'HP:0011852', 'HP:0012086', 'HP:0012378', 'HP:0012733', 'HP:0012735', 'HP:0012798', 'HP:0100543', 'HP:0100749', 'HP:0100750', 'HP:0100763', 'HP:0100804']"

A heart condition called cardiomyopathy, which weakens and enlarges the heart muscle, is another common feature of malonyl-CoA decarboxylase deficiency.
Some common symptoms in Malonyl-CoA decarboxylase deficiency, such as cardiomyopathy and metabolic acidosis, are triggered by the high concentrations of Malonyl-CoA in the cytoplasm. High levels of Malonyl-CoA will inhibit β-oxidation of fatty acids through deactivating the carrier of fatty acyl group, CPT1, and thus, blocking fatty acids from going into the mitochondrial matrix for oxidation.A research conducted in Netherlands has suggested that carnitine supplements and a low fat diet may help to reduce the level of malonic acid in our body.","['HP:0001250', 'HP:0001252', 'HP:0001263', 'HP:0001290', 'HP:0001302', 'HP:0001639', 'HP:0001942', 'HP:0001943', 'HP:0001946', 'HP:0002013', 'HP:0002014', 'HP:0002019', 'HP:0002027', 'HP:0003128', 'HP:0004322', 'HP:0012450']"

253200,"Maroteaux–Lamy syndrome, several forms","Unlike other MPS diseases, children with Maroteaux–Lamy syndrome usually have normal intelligence. They share many of the physical symptoms found in Hurler syndrome. Maroteaux–Lamy syndrome has a variable spectrum of severe symptoms. Neurological complications include clouded corneas, deafness, thickening of the dura (the membrane that surrounds and protects the brain and spinal cord), and pain caused by compressed or traumatized nerves and nerve roots.
Signs are revealed early in the affected child's life, with one of the first symptoms often being a significantly prolonged age of learning how to walk. Growth begins normally, but children usually stop growing by age 8. By age 10, children often develop a shortened trunk, crouched stance, and restricted joint movement.

232600,McArdle disease,"The onset of this disease is usually noticed in childhood, but often not diagnosed until the third or fourth decade of life. Symptoms include exercise intolerance with muscle pain, early fatigue, painful cramps, and myoglobin in the urine (often provoked by a bout of exercise).  Myoglobinuria may result from the breakdown of skeletal muscle known as rhabdomyolysis, a condition in which muscle cells breakdown, sending their contents into the bloodstream.
Patients may exhibit a “second wind” phenomenon. This is characterized by the patient's better tolerance for aerobic exercise such as walking and cycling after approximately 10 minutes.  This is attributed to the combination of increased blood flow and the ability of the body to find alternative sources of energy, like fatty acids and proteins. In the long term, patients may exhibit kidney failure due to the myoglobinuria, and with age, patients may exhibit progressively increasing weakness and substantial muscle loss.
Patients may present at emergency rooms with severe fixed contractures of the muscles and often severe pain. These require urgent assessment for rhabdomyolysis as in about 30% of cases this leads to acute kidney injury. Left untreated, this can be life-threatening. In a small number of cases compartment syndrome has developed, requiring prompt surgical referral.","['HP:0000083', 'HP:0001324', 'HP:0001626', 'HP:0001639', 'HP:0001649', 'HP:0001919', 'HP:0002015', 'HP:0002875', 'HP:0002913', 'HP:0003198', 'HP:0003201', 'HP:0003202', 'HP:0003236', 'HP:0003546', 'HP:0003652', 'HP:0003710', 'HP:0003738', 'HP:0005216', 'HP:0008305', 'HP:0008967', 'HP:0009045', 'HP:0009051', 'HP:0009073', 'HP:0012378', 'HP:0012622', 'HP:0030231', 'HP:0030234', 'HP:0030973', 'HP:0040319']"

As such, the clinical presentation of patients with McCune Albright syndrome varies greatly depending on the disease features.Various endocrine diseases may present in McCune–Albright syndrome due to increased hormone production.

Precocious puberty: The most common endocrinopathy is precocious puberty, which presents in girls (~85%) with recurrent estrogen-producing cysts leading to episodic breast development, growth acceleration, and vaginal bleeding. Precocious puberty may also occur in boys with McCune–Albright syndrome, but is much less common (~10–15%).
Testicular abnormalities: Testicular abnormalities are seen in a majority (~85%) of boys with McCune–Albright syndrome.
Hyperthyroidism: Hyperthyroidism occurs in approximately one-third of patients with McCune Albright syndrome. Many others may suffer from other kinds of thyroid involvement.
Growth Hormone Excess: GNAS mutation in the anterior pituitary can result in excess growth hormone secretion and is found in approximately 10–15% of patients.

Both occur particularly with liver metastasis, and either symptom may be the first manifestation of the disease.  The flushing that occurs in medullary thyroid carcinoma is indistinguishable from that associated with carcinoid syndrome.  In MTC, the flushing, diarrhea, and itching (pruritus) are all caused by elevated levels of calcitonin gene products (calcitonin or calcitonin gene-related peptide).  By comparison, the flushing and diarrhea observed in carcinoid syndrome is caused by elevated levels of circulating serotonin.
Medullary thyroid carcinoma may also produce a thyroid nodule and enlarged cervical lymph nodes.Sites of spread of medullary thyroid carcinoma include local lymph nodes in the neck, lymph nodes in the central portion of the chest (mediastinum), liver, lung, and bone.

Symptoms include muscle wasting and weakness, muscle rigidity, developmental delays, progressive loss of vision leading to blindness, convulsions, impaired swallowing, paralysis, and dementia. Children may become comatose. Untreated, most children with this form of MLD die by age 5, often much sooner.
Children with the juvenile form of MLD (onset between 3 and 10 years of age) usually begin with impaired school performance, mental deterioration, and dementia, then develop symptoms similar to the late infantile form but with slower progression. Age of death is variable, but normally within 10 to 15 years of symptom onset. Some patients can live for several decades after onset.
The adult form commonly begins after age 16 often with an onset in the 4th or 5th decade of life and presents  as a psychiatric disorder or progressive dementia. Adult-onset MLD usually progresses more slowly than the late infantile and juvenile forms, with a protracted course of a decade or more.Palliative care can help with many of the symptoms and usually improves quality of life and longevity.
Carriers have low enzyme levels compared to their family population (""normal"" levels vary from family to family) but even low enzyme levels are adequate to process the body's sulfatide.","['HP:0000020', 'HP:0000648', 'HP:0000649', 'HP:0000712', 'HP:0000736', 'HP:0000738', 'HP:0000746', 'HP:0000762', 'HP:0001082', 'HP:0001249', 'HP:0001250', 'HP:0001251', 'HP:0001252', 'HP:0001257', 'HP:0001260', 'HP:0001265', 'HP:0001268', 'HP:0001283', 'HP:0001288', 'HP:0001290', 'HP:0001324', 'HP:0001332', 'HP:0001347', 'HP:0001939', 'HP:0002072', 'HP:0002080', 'HP:0002312', 'HP:0002359', 'HP:0002371', 'HP:0002376', 'HP:0002415', 'HP:0002445', 'HP:0002500', 'HP:0002510', 'HP:0002922', 'HP:0003270', 'HP:0003444', 'HP:0003445', 'HP:0003487', 'HP:0004343', 'HP:0005609', 'HP:0007133', 'HP:0007240', 'HP:0007272', 'HP:0007663', 'HP:0008619', 'HP:0011096', 'HP:0012433', 'HP:0025013', 'HP:0030081', 'HP:0031358']"

607014,Mucopolysaccharidosis Ih,"Children with Hurler syndrome may appear normal at birth and develop symptoms over the first years of life. Symptoms vary between patients.
One of the first abnormalities that may be detected is coarsening of the facial features; these symptoms can begin at 3-6 months of age. The head can be large with prominent frontal bones. The skull can be elongated. The nose can have a flattened nasal bridge with continuous nasal discharge. The eye sockets may be widely spaced, and the eyes may protrude from the skull. The lips can be large, and affected children may hold their jaws open constantly. Skeletal abnormalities occur by about age 6 months, but may not be clinically obvious until 10-14 months. Patients may experience debilitating spine and hip deformities, carpal tunnel syndrome, and joint stiffness. Patients may be normal height in infancy, but stop growing by the age of 2 years. They may not reach a height of greater than 4 feet.
Other early symptoms may include inguinal and umbilical hernias. These may be present at birth, or they may develop within the first months of life. Clouding of the cornea and retinal degeneration may occur within the first year of life, leading to blindness. Enlarged liver and spleen are common. There is no organ dysfunction, but GAG deposition in these organs may lead to a massive increase in size. Patients may also have diarrhea. Aortic valve disease may occur.

3 or more relatives with an HNPCC-associated cancer (i.e., colorectal, cancer of the endometrium, small bowel, ureter, or renal pelvis)
2 or more successive generations affected by cancer
1 or more persons with cancer is a first-degree relative of the other 2, at least 1 case of colorectal cancer younger than age 50 years, a diagnosis of familial adenomatous polyposis has been excluded, tumors are verified by histologic examinationMuir–Torre syndrome is a genetic condition. Mutations in MLH1 and MSH2 are linked with the disease. These genes code for DNA mismatch repair genes, and mutations increase the risk of developing cancerous qualities.Many patients who have sebaceous neoplasms with mutations in MSH2 and MLH1 do not in fact have Muir–Torre syndrome. The Mayo Muir–Torre risk score was devised to improve the positive predictive value of immunohistochemistry and reduce the false positive rate. 
The Mayo Muir–Torre Risk score assigns points based several characteristics. A score of 2 or greater has a high positive predictive value of Muir–Torre syndrome. A score of 1 or lower is less likely to be Muir–Torre syndrome.Age of onset of first sebaceous neoplasm: <60 years = 1 point, otherwise 0 points
Total number of sebaceous neoplasms: 1 = 0 points, >2 = 2 points.
Personal history of Lynch related cancers: No = 0 points, Yes = 1 point 
Family history of Lynch-related cancer: No = 0 points, Yes = 1 point

Patellar involvement is present in approximately 90% of patients; however, patellar aplasia occurs in only 20%.
In instances in which the patellae are smaller or luxated, the knees may be unstable.
The elbows may have limited motion (e.g., limited pronation, supination, extension).
Subluxation of the radial head may occur.
Arthrodysplasia of the elbows is reported in approximately 90% of patients.
General hyperextension of the joints can be present.
Exostoses arising from the posterior aspect of the iliac bones (""iliac horns"") are present in as many as 80% of patients; this finding is considered pathognomonic for the syndrome.
Other reported bone changes include scoliosis, scapular hypoplasia, and the presence of cervical ribs.
		
Kidney issues may arise such as deposition of protein in the urine and nephritis.  Proteinuria is usually the first sign of kidney involvement and either rapidly or years after suffering from asymptomatic deposition of protein in the urine, kidney failure occurs in around 5% of NPS patients.

607107,Nasopharyngeal carcinoma,"NPC may present as a lump or a mass on both sides towards the back of the neck. These lumps usually are not tender or painful but appear as a result of the metastatic spread of the cancer to the lymph nodes, thus causing the lymph nodes to swell. Lymph nodes are defined as glands that function as part of the immune system and can be found throughout the body. Swelling of the lymph nodes in the neck is the initial presentation in many people, and the diagnosis of NPC is often made by lymph node biopsy. Signs of nasopharyngeal cancer may appear as headaches, a sore throat, and trouble hearing, breathing, or speaking. Additional symptoms of NPC include facial pain or numbness, blurred or double vision, trouble opening the mouth, or recurring ear infections. If the ear infection does not present with an upper respiratory tract infection, then an examination should be done on the nasopharynx. This is due to the fact that, in adults, ear infections are less common than in children. Signs and symptoms related to the primary tumor include trismus, pain, otitis media, nasal regurgitation due to paresis (loss of or impaired movement) of the soft palate, hearing loss and cranial nerve palsy (paralysis). Larger growths may produce nasal obstruction or bleeding and a ""nasal twang"". Metastatic spread may result in bone pain or organ dysfunction.

Because NM only becomes worse, even with treatment, people who show early signs of NM only become weaker faster as opposed to a teenager who is just now showing symptoms, for example.

256500,Netherton syndrome,"Netherton syndrome is characterized by chronic skin inflammation, universal pruritus (itch), severe dehydration, and stunted growth. Patients with this disorder tend to have a hair shaft defect (trichorrhexis invaginata), also known as ""bamboo hair"". The disrupted skin barrier function in affected individuals also presents a high susceptibility to infection and allergy, leading to the development of scaly, reddish skin similar to atopic dermatitis. In severe cases, these atopic manifestations persist throughout the individual's life, and consequently post-natal mortality rates are high. In less severe cases, this develops into the milder ichthyosis linearis circumflexa.Netherton syndrome has recently been characterised as a primary immunodeficiency, which straddles the innate and acquired immune system, much as does Wiskott–Aldrich syndrome.  A group of Netherton patients have been demonstrated to have altered immunoglobulin levels (typically high IgE and low to normal IgG) and immature natural killer cells. These Natural Killer cells have a reduced lytic function; which can be improved with regular infusions of immunoglobulin (see 'Treatment'); although the mechanism for this is not clear.Patients are more prone than healthy people to infections of all types, especially recurrent skin infections with staphylococcus.  They may have more severe infections; but are not as vulnerable to opportunistic pathogens as patients with true Natural Killer cell deficiency-type SCID.","['HP:0000086', 'HP:0000126', 'HP:0000535', 'HP:0000653', 'HP:0000956', 'HP:0000958', 'HP:0000964', 'HP:0000988', 'HP:0001019', 'HP:0001025', 'HP:0001036', 'HP:0001249', 'HP:0001250', 'HP:0001263', 'HP:0001508', 'HP:0001595', 'HP:0001944', 'HP:0002024', 'HP:0002097', 'HP:0002099', 'HP:0002205', 'HP:0002209', 'HP:0002213', 'HP:0002242', 'HP:0002299', 'HP:0002719', 'HP:0003011', 'HP:0003193', 'HP:0003212', 'HP:0003355', 'HP:0004313', 'HP:0004315', 'HP:0004322', 'HP:0004779', 'HP:0004906', 'HP:0007400', 'HP:0007479', 'HP:0008064', 'HP:0009886', 'HP:0011100', 'HP:0011473', 'HP:0032061', 'HP:0100326', 'HP:0100665', 'HP:0500093']"

256700,Neuroblastoma,"The first symptoms of neuroblastoma are often vague, making diagnosis difficult. Fatigue, loss of appetite, fever, and joint pain are common. Symptoms depend on primary tumor locations and metastases if present:
In the abdomen, a tumor may cause a swollen belly and constipation.
A tumor in the chest may cause breathing problems.
A tumor pressing on the spinal cord may cause weakness, thus an inability to stand, crawl, or walk.
Bone lesions in the legs and hips may cause pain and limping.
A tumor in the bones around the eyes or orbits may cause distinct bruising and swelling.
Infiltration of the bone marrow may cause pallor from anemia.Neuroblastoma often spreads to other parts of the body before any symptoms are apparent, and 50 to 60% of all neuroblastoma cases present with metastases.The most common location for neuroblastoma to originate (i.e., the primary tumor) is in the adrenal glands.  This occurs in 40% of localized tumors and in 60% of cases of widespread disease. Neuroblastoma can also develop anywhere along the sympathetic nervous system chain from the neck to the pelvis.  Frequencies in different locations include: neck (1%), chest (19%), abdomen (30% nonadrenal), or pelvis (1%). In rare cases, no primary tumor can be discerned.Rare but characteristic presentations include transverse myelopathy (tumor spinal cord compression, 5% of cases), treatment-resistant diarrhea (tumor vasoactive intestinal peptide secretion, 4% of cases), Horner's syndrome (cervical tumor, 2.4% of cases), opsoclonus myoclonus syndrome and ataxia (suspected paraneoplastic cause, 1.3% of cases), and hypertension (catecholamine secretion or kidney artery compression, 1.3% of cases).",[]

dystonia (repetitive uncontrollable muscle contractions that may cause jerking or twisting of certain muscle groups)
dysphagia & dysarthria due to muscle groups involved in speech being involved
rigidity/stiffness of limbs
tremor
writhing movements
dementia
spasticity
weakness
seizures (rare)
toe walking
retinitis pigmentosa, another degenerative disease that affects the individual's retina, often causing alteration of retinal color and progressive deterioration of the retina at first causing night blindness and later resulting in a complete loss of vision.25% of individuals experience an uncharacteristic form of PKAN that develops post-10 years of age and follows a slower, more gradual pace of deterioration than those pre-10 years of age.  These individuals face significant speech deficits as well as psychiatric and behavioral disturbances.
Being a progressive, degenerative nerve illness, PKAN leads to early immobility and often death by early adulthood.

603554,Omenn syndrome,"The symptoms are very similar to graft-versus-host disease (GVHD). This is because the patients have some T cells with limited levels of recombination with the mutant RAG genes. These T cells are abnormal and have a very specific affinity for self antigens found in the thymus and in the periphery. Therefore, these T cells are auto-reactive and cause the GVHD phenotype.
A characteristic symptom is chronic inflammation of the skin, which appears as a red rash (early onset erythroderma). Other symptoms include eosinophilia, failure to thrive, swollen lymph nodes, swollen spleen, diarrhea, enlarged liver, low immunoglobulin levels (except immunoglobulin E, which is elevated), low T cell levels, and no B cells.","['HP:0000100', 'HP:0000778', 'HP:0000821', 'HP:0000944', 'HP:0000958', 'HP:0000969', 'HP:0000989', 'HP:0001006', 'HP:0001019', 'HP:0001072', 'HP:0001508', 'HP:0001596', 'HP:0001744', 'HP:0001831', 'HP:0001873', 'HP:0001880', 'HP:0001903', 'HP:0001945', 'HP:0001974', 'HP:0002014', 'HP:0002028', 'HP:0002090', 'HP:0002240', 'HP:0002665', 'HP:0002716', 'HP:0002718', 'HP:0002841', 'HP:0002960', 'HP:0003075', 'HP:0004332', 'HP:0004429', 'HP:0004430', 'HP:0005365', 'HP:0007549', 'HP:0010976', 'HP:0100646', 'HP:0100806', 'HP:0100840']"

311250,Ornithine transcarbamylase deficiency,"OTC deficiency can become apparent at any age. Early-onset OTC deficiency is most commonly found in males. Later in life, the disease may present in both males and females. 
In the classic presentation, a male infant appears well initially, but by the second day of life becomes irritable, lethargic, and stops feeding. Infants may have poorly-controlled body temperature and respiratory rates, and may experience seizures. Without urgent intervention, a metabolic encephalopathy develops; this can progress to coma and death within the first week of life. High levels of ammonia cause preferential damage to the brain, leading to devastating consequences.Later onset forms of OTC deficiency can have variable presentations. Although late onset forms of the disease are often considered milder than the classic infantile presentation, any affected individual is at risk for an episode of hyperammonemia that could still be life-threatening if presented with the appropriate stressors. These patients will often present with headaches, nausea, vomiting, delirium, erratic behavior, or seizures. A detailed dietary history of an affected individual with undiagnosed OTC deficiency will often reveal a history of protein avoidance.The prognosis of a patient with severe OTC deficiency is well correlated with the length of the hyperammonemic period rather than the degree of hyperammonemia or the presence of other symptoms, such as seizures. Even for patients with late onset forms of the disease, their overall clinical picture is dependent on the extent of hyperammonemia they have experienced, even if it has remained unrecognized.","['HP:0000737', 'HP:0001249', 'HP:0001250', 'HP:0001251', 'HP:0001254', 'HP:0001259', 'HP:0001263', 'HP:0001297', 'HP:0001399', 'HP:0001508', 'HP:0001744', 'HP:0001943', 'HP:0001950', 'HP:0001951', 'HP:0001987', 'HP:0002013', 'HP:0002021', 'HP:0002038', 'HP:0002131', 'HP:0002181', 'HP:0003217', 'HP:0003355', 'HP:0003572']"

Paget's disease affecting the skull may cause frontal bossing, increased hat size, and headaches. Often patients may develop loss of hearing in one or both ears due to auditory foramen narrowing and resultant compression of the nerves in the inner ear.

260350,Pancreatic cancer,"Since pancreatic cancer usually does not cause recognizable symptoms in its early stages, the disease is typically not diagnosed until it has spread beyond the pancreas itself.  This is one of the main reasons for the generally poor survival rates. Exceptions to this are the functioning PanNETs, where over-production of various active hormones can give rise to symptoms (which depend on the type of hormone).Bearing in mind that the disease is rarely diagnosed before the age of 40, common symptoms of pancreatic adenocarcinoma occurring before diagnosis include:

Pain in the upper abdomen or back, often spreading from around the stomach to the back. The location of the pain can indicate the part of the pancreas where a tumor is located. The pain may be worse at night and may increase over time to become severe and unremitting. It may be slightly relieved by bending forward. In the UK, about half of new cases of pancreatic cancer are diagnosed following a visit to a hospital emergency department for pain or jaundice. In up to two-thirds of people abdominal pain is the main symptom, for 46% of the total accompanied by jaundice, with 13% having jaundice without pain.
Jaundice, a yellow tint to the whites of the eyes or skin, with or without pain, and possibly in combination with darkened urine. This results when a cancer in the head of the pancreas obstructs the common bile duct as it runs through the pancreas.
Unexplained weight loss, either from loss of appetite, or loss of exocrine function resulting in poor digestion.
The tumor may compress neighboring organs, disrupting digestive processes and making it difficult for the stomach to empty, which may cause nausea and a feeling of fullness. The undigested fat leads to foul-smelling, fatty feces that are difficult to flush away. Constipation is also common.
At least 50% of people with pancreatic adenocarcinoma have diabetes at the time of diagnosis. While long-standing diabetes is a known risk factor for pancreatic cancer (see Risk factors), the cancer can itself cause diabetes, in which case recent onset of diabetes could be considered an early sign of the disease. People over 50 who develop diabetes have eight times the usual risk of developing pancreatic adenocarcinoma within three years, after which the relative risk declines.","['HP:0000819', 'HP:0000952', 'HP:0001433', 'HP:0001738', 'HP:0001824', 'HP:0002017', 'HP:0002027', 'HP:0002039', 'HP:0002254', 'HP:0002716', 'HP:0002861', 'HP:0002894', 'HP:0002896', 'HP:0002910', 'HP:0003002', 'HP:0003003', 'HP:0003418', 'HP:0004389', 'HP:0004396', 'HP:0005249', 'HP:0006725', 'HP:0012334', 'HP:0012432', 'HP:0025318', 'HP:0100592', 'HP:0410067']"
613347,Pancreatic cancer,"Since pancreatic cancer usually does not cause recognizable symptoms in its early stages, the disease is typically not diagnosed until it has spread beyond the pancreas itself.  This is one of the main reasons for the generally poor survival rates. Exceptions to this are the functioning PanNETs, where over-production of various active hormones can give rise to symptoms (which depend on the type of hormone).Bearing in mind that the disease is rarely diagnosed before the age of 40, common symptoms of pancreatic adenocarcinoma occurring before diagnosis include:

Pain in the upper abdomen or back, often spreading from around the stomach to the back. The location of the pain can indicate the part of the pancreas where a tumor is located. The pain may be worse at night and may increase over time to become severe and unremitting. It may be slightly relieved by bending forward. In the UK, about half of new cases of pancreatic cancer are diagnosed following a visit to a hospital emergency department for pain or jaundice. In up to two-thirds of people abdominal pain is the main symptom, for 46% of the total accompanied by jaundice, with 13% having jaundice without pain.
Jaundice, a yellow tint to the whites of the eyes or skin, with or without pain, and possibly in combination with darkened urine. This results when a cancer in the head of the pancreas obstructs the common bile duct as it runs through the pancreas.
Unexplained weight loss, either from loss of appetite, or loss of exocrine function resulting in poor digestion.
The tumor may compress neighboring organs, disrupting digestive processes and making it difficult for the stomach to empty, which may cause nausea and a feeling of fullness. The undigested fat leads to foul-smelling, fatty feces that are difficult to flush away. Constipation is also common.

168300,Paramyotonia congenita,"Patients typically complain of muscle stiffness that can continue to focal weakness. This muscle stiffness cannot be walked off, in contrast to myotonia congenita. These symptoms are increased (and sometimes induced) in cold environments. For example, some patients have reported that eating ice cream leads to a stiffening of the throat. For other patients, exercise consistently induces symptoms of myotonia or weakness. Typical presentations of this are during squatting or repetitive fist clenching. Some patients also indicate that specific foods are able to induce symptoms of paramyotonia congenita. Isolated cases have reported that carrots and watermelon are able to induce these symptoms.

608355,Parkes Weber syndrome,"Major symptoms of PWS include:
Birthmarks: Affected PWS patients suffer from large, flat, pink staining on the skin. This staining is a result of the capillary malformations that have the tendency to increase the blood flow near the surface of the skin causing the staining. Because of the staining color they are sometimes referred to as ""port-wine stains"". ""Port-wine stain"" or discoloration of the skin due to vascular malformation is also referred as nevus flammeus.Hypertrophy: Hypertrophy refers to excessive growth of the bone and soft tissue. In PWS patients a limb is overgrown and hypertrophy is usually seen in the affected limb.

Multiple arteriovenous fistulas: PWS patients also suffer from multiple AVFs that occur in conjunction with capillary malformations. AVFs occur because of abnormal connections between arteries and veins. Normally, blood flows from arteries to capillaries then to veins. But for AFV patients, because of the abnormal artery and vein connections, blood flows directly from arteries into the veins completely bypassing the capillaries.  These irregular connections affect the blood circulation and may lead to life-threatening complications such as abnormal bleeding and heart failure. AVFs can be identified by: large, purplish bulging veins, swelling in limbs, decreased in blood pressure, fatigue and heart failure.Capillary arteriovenous malformations: Vascular system disorder is the cause of the capillary malformations. Here, the capillaries are enlarged and increase the blood flow towards the surface of the skin. Because of the capillary malformations, the skin has multiple small, round, pink or even red dots. For most of the affected individuals, these malformations occur on the face, arms and or legs. The spots may be visible right from birth itself or they may develop during childhood years. If capillary malformations occur by themselves, it is not a huge threat to life. But when these occur in conjunction with AVFs then it is a clear indicator of PWS and may be serious depending on the severity of the malformations.The Human Phenotype Ontology (HPO) reports of additional symptoms in PWS patients. HPO is an active database that collects and researches on the relationships between phenotypic abnormalities and biochemical networks. This is a useful database as it has information and data on some of the rarest diseases such as PWS.  According to HPO, the symptoms which are reported very frequently in PWS patients include: abnormal bleeding, hypertrophy of the lower limb, hypertrophy of the upper limb, nevus flammeus or staining of the skin, peripheral arteriovenous fistula, telangiectasia of the skin. Frequent to occasional symptoms include: varicose veins, congestive heart failure, glaucoma and headache.
Abnormal bleeding: some skin lesions are prone to bleed easily.Peripheral arteriovenous fistula: abnormal communication between artery and vein that is a direct result of the abnormal connection or wiring between the artery and vein.Telangiectasia of the skin: Telangiectasia is a condition where tiny blood vessels become widened and form threadlike red lines and or patterns on the skin. Because of their appearance and formation of web-like patterns they are also known as spider veins. These patterns are referred as telangiectases.

Varicose veins: Enlarged, swollen and twisted veins.Congestive heart failure: This is a condition in which the heart’s ability to meet the requirements of the body is diminished. The cardiac output is decreased and the amount of blood pumped is not adequate enough to keep the circulation from the body and lungs going.Glaucoma: Glaucoma is a combination of diseases that cause damage to the optic nerve and may result in vision loss and blindness.Headache: pain in the head.","['HP:0000501', 'HP:0001052', 'HP:0001269', 'HP:0001635', 'HP:0001892', 'HP:0002315', 'HP:0002619', 'HP:0004947', 'HP:0010484', 'HP:0010496', 'HP:0011276', 'HP:0100585', 'HP:0100784']"
167400,Paroxysmal extreme pain disorder,"The most distinctive feature of PEPD is episodic burning pain of the rectum, ocular, and mandibular regions. It should be stressed that while pain often originates or is centered in these areas it can also spread or be diffuse in nature. Pain experienced by patients with this disorder should not be underestimated as women with the disorder who have also given birth describe PEPD pain as worse than labor pain. Concomitant with this pain is typically flushing, often in an area associated with the pain.During attacks in infants, the child often looks startled or terrified and can scream inconsolably. These attacks can be precipitated by injections, defecation, wiping of the perineum, eating, or the consumption of oral medication. When attacks occur due to such precipitation, pain and flushing are often present in the area of attack precipitation, though symptoms may also be diffuse in nature.Other symptoms may include hypersalivation when attacks are localized in the mandibular region, or leg weakness after foot trauma. A prominent non-physical symptom are tonic non-epileptic seizures. Such seizures are more common in infancy and childhood than during adulthood. In older children, inconsolable screaming usually precedes such attack, followed by apnea, paleness, and stiffness. Such stiffness can last from seconds to a few minutes.Attack precipitants are usually physical in nature, such as defecation, eating, or taking medicine. Some less common precipitants are micturition, coitus, and painful stimuli. There are also non-physical precipitants, such as the thought or sight of food. In general attacks tend to occur in the precipitated area, though this is not always the case. While some individuals have described a build-up to attacks, in general they tend to be abrupt. The duration of these attacks can be from a few seconds to two hours.Patients are largely normal between attacks. The only notable interictal problem is constipation, likely due to apprehension of precipitating an attack. This symptom often decreases with age, likely due to coping mechanisms such as the use of stool softeners.","['HP:0000632', 'HP:0001250', 'HP:0001649', 'HP:0001662', 'HP:0002019', 'HP:0007328', 'HP:0031284', 'HP:0031417', 'HP:0200025', 'HP:0200026', 'HP:0500005']"

Often the first presentation is a bowel obstruction from an intussusception which is a common cause of mortality; an intussusception is a telescoping of one loop of bowel into another segment.","['HP:0000069', 'HP:0000138', 'HP:0000366', 'HP:0000771', 'HP:0001003', 'HP:0001034', 'HP:0001080', 'HP:0001217', 'HP:0001891', 'HP:0001903', 'HP:0002013', 'HP:0002027', 'HP:0002035', 'HP:0002086', 'HP:0002239', 'HP:0002576', 'HP:0002584', 'HP:0002664', 'HP:0002672', 'HP:0002894', 'HP:0003002', 'HP:0004390', 'HP:0005214', 'HP:0005244', 'HP:0005264', 'HP:0005562', 'HP:0005584', 'HP:0006725', 'HP:0008204', 'HP:0008675', 'HP:0010784', 'HP:0011024', 'HP:0012126', 'HP:0012720', 'HP:0012733', 'HP:0030079', 'HP:0031261', 'HP:0032451', 'HP:0032454', 'HP:0100273', 'HP:0100526', 'HP:0100574', 'HP:0100582', 'HP:0100644', 'HP:0100669', 'HP:0100743', 'HP:0100751', 'HP:0100759', 'HP:0100833']"

The head is unable to grow normally, which leads to a high prominent forehead (turribrachycephaly), and eyes that appear to bulge (proptosis) and are wide-set (hypertelorism). In addition, there is an underdeveloped upper jaw (maxillary hypoplasia). About 50 percent of children with Pfeiffer syndrome have hearing loss; dental problems are also common.In people with Pfeiffer syndrome, the thumbs and first (big) toes are wide and bend away from the other digits (pollex varus and hallux varus).

261600,Phenylketonuria,"Untreated PKU can lead to intellectual disability, seizures, behavioral problems, and mental disorders. It may also result in a musty smell and lighter skin. A baby born to a mother who has poorly treated PKU may have heart problems, a small head, and low birth weight.Because the mother's body is able to break down phenylalanine during pregnancy, infants with PKU are normal at birth. The disease is not detectable by physical examination at that time, because no damage has yet been done. Newborn screening is performed to detect the disease and initiate treatment before any damage is done. The blood sample is usually taken by a heel prick, typically performed 2–7 days after birth. This test can reveal elevated phenylalanine levels after one or two days of normal infant feeding.If a child is not diagnosed during the routine newborn screening test and a phenylalanine restricted diet is not introduced, then phenylalanine levels in the blood will increase over time. Toxic levels of phenylalanine (and insufficient levels of tyrosine) can interfere with infant development in ways which have permanent effects. The disease may present clinically with seizures,  hypopigmentation (excessively fair hair and skin), and a ""musty odor"" to the baby's sweat and urine (due to phenylacetate, a carboxylic acid produced by the oxidation of phenylketone). In most cases, a repeat test should be done at approximately two weeks of age to verify the initial test and uncover any phenylketonuria that was initially missed.
Untreated children often fail to attain early developmental milestones, develop microcephaly, and demonstrate progressive impairment of cerebral function. Hyperactivity, EEG abnormalities, and seizures, and severe learning disabilities are major clinical problems later in life. A characteristic ""musty or mousy"" odor on the skin, as well as a predisposition for eczema, persist throughout life in the absence of treatment.
The damage done to the brain if PKU is untreated during the first months of life is not reversible. It is critical to control the diet of infants with PKU very carefully so that the brain has an opportunity to develop normally. Affected children who are detected at birth and treated are much less likely to develop neurological problems or have seizures and intellectual disability (though such clinical disorders are still possible.)
In general, however, outcomes for people treated for PKU are good. Treated people may have no detectable physical, neurological, or developmental problems at all.","['HP:0000252', 'HP:0000518', 'HP:0000635', 'HP:0000709', 'HP:0000716', 'HP:0000718', 'HP:0000722', 'HP:0000737', 'HP:0000739', 'HP:0000742', 'HP:0000752', 'HP:0000958', 'HP:0000964', 'HP:0001249', 'HP:0001250', 'HP:0001347', 'HP:0002286', 'HP:0002514', 'HP:0002686', 'HP:0003355', 'HP:0004920', 'HP:0004923', 'HP:0005982', 'HP:0007018', 'HP:0007513', 'HP:0010864', 'HP:0030680', 'HP:0100324', 'HP:0100610', 'HP:0410066']"
171300,Pheochromocytoma,"The signs and symptoms of a pheochromocytoma are those of sympathetic nervous system hyperactivity, with three classic signs: diaphoresis (excessive sweating), headaches and elevated heart rate, including:

Skin sensations
Flank pain
Elevated blood pressure, including paroxysmal (sporadic, episodic) high blood pressure, which sometimes can be more difficult to detect; another clue to the presence of pheochromocytoma is orthostatic hypotension (a fall in systolic blood pressure greater than 20 mmHg or a fall in diastolic blood pressure greater than 10 mmHg upon standing)
Anxiety often resembling that of a panic attack
Pallor
Weight loss
Localized amyloid deposits found microscopically
Elevated blood glucose level (due primarily to catecholamine stimulation of lipolysis (breakdown of stored fat) leading to high levels of free fatty acids and the subsequent inhibition of glucose uptake by muscle cells. Further, stimulation of beta-adrenergic receptors leads to glycogenolysis and gluconeogenesis and thus elevation of blood glucose levels).A pheochromocytoma can also cause resistant arterial hypertension. A pheochromocytoma can be fatal if it causes a hypertensive emergency, that is, severely high blood pressure that impairs one or more organ systems (formerly called ""malignant hypertension""). This hypertension is not well controlled with standard blood pressure medications.
Tumors may grow large, but most are smaller than 10 centimetres (4 in).
Pheochromocytoma crisis is a rare and potentially lifethreatening emergency. It can occur spontaneously or be precipitated by administration of pharmacological agents, tumor manipulation, micturition (urinary bladder pheochromocytoma), or foods that aggravate release of catecholamines by the tumor.","['HP:0000093', 'HP:0000519', 'HP:0000875', 'HP:0000957', 'HP:0000975', 'HP:0001028', 'HP:0001095', 'HP:0001342', 'HP:0001635', 'HP:0001649', 'HP:0001920', 'HP:0002664', 'HP:0002666', 'HP:0003072', 'HP:0003345', 'HP:0003574']"

A characteristic of Pick’s disease is that dysfunctional, argumentative, or hostile social conduct is initially exhibited towards family members and not initially exhibited in a workplace or neutral environment.  PiD is highly hereditary. The changes in personality allow doctors to distinguish between PiD and Alzheimer disease.

184700,Polycystic ovary syndrome,"Common signs and symptoms of PCOS include the following:

Menstrual disorders: PCOS mostly produces oligomenorrhea (fewer than nine menstrual periods in a year) or amenorrhea (no menstrual periods for three or more consecutive months), but other types of menstrual disorders may also occur.
Infertility: This generally results directly from chronic anovulation (lack of ovulation).
High levels of masculinizing hormones:  Known as hyperandrogenism, the most common signs are acne and hirsutism (male pattern of hair growth, such as on the chin or chest), but it may produce hypermenorrhea (heavy and prolonged menstrual periods), androgenic alopecia (increased hair thinning or diffuse hair loss), or other symptoms. Approximately three-quarters of women with PCOS (by the diagnostic criteria of NIH/NICHD 1990) have evidence of hyperandrogenemia.
Metabolic syndrome:  This appears as a tendency towards central obesity and other symptoms associated with insulin resistance. Serum insulin, insulin resistance, and homocysteine levels are higher in women with PCOS.Women with PCOS tend to have central obesity, but studies are conflicting as to whether visceral and subcutaneous abdominal fat is increased, unchanged, or decreased in women with PCOS relative to reproductively normal women with the same body mass index. In any case, androgens, such as testosterone, androstanolone (dihydrotestosterone), and nandrolone decanoate have been found to increase visceral fat deposition in both female animals and women.Although 80% of PCOS presents in women with obesity, 20% of women diagnosed with the disease are non-obese or ""lean"" women.

263300,Polycythemia vera,"People with polycythemia vera can be asymptomatic. A classic symptom of polycythemia vera is pruritus or itching, particularly after exposure to warm water (such as when taking a bath), which may be due to abnormal histamine release or prostaglandin production. Such itching is present in approximately 40% of patients with polycythemia vera. Gouty arthritis may be present in up to 20% of patients. Peptic ulcer disease is also common in patients with polycythemia vera; most likely due to increased histamine from mast cells, but may be related to an increased susceptibility to infection with the ulcer-causing bacterium H. pylori. Another possible mechanism for the development for peptic ulcer is increased histamine release and gastric hyperacidity related with polycythemia vera.
A classic symptom of polycythemia vera (and the related myeloproliferative disease essential thrombocythemia) is erythromelalgia. This is a burning pain in the hands or feet, usually accompanied by a reddish or bluish coloration of the skin. Erythromelalgia is caused by an increased platelet count or increased platelet ""stickiness"" (aggregation), resulting in the formation of tiny blood clots in the vessels of the extremity; it responds rapidly to treatment with aspirin.Patients with polycythemia vera are prone to the development of blood clots (thrombosis). A major thrombotic complication (e.g. heart attack, stroke, deep venous thrombosis, or Budd-Chiari syndrome) may sometimes be the first symptom or indication that a person has polycythemia vera.Headaches, lack of concentration and fatigue are common symptoms that occur in patients with polycythemia vera as well.","['HP:0000225', 'HP:0000360', 'HP:0000421', 'HP:0000822', 'HP:0000978', 'HP:0000989', 'HP:0001297', 'HP:0001342', 'HP:0001409', 'HP:0001681', 'HP:0001744', 'HP:0001824', 'HP:0001873', 'HP:0001894', 'HP:0001898', 'HP:0001899', 'HP:0001900', 'HP:0001907', 'HP:0001974', 'HP:0001977', 'HP:0002027', 'HP:0002093', 'HP:0002204', 'HP:0002239', 'HP:0002240', 'HP:0002315', 'HP:0002321', 'HP:0002488', 'HP:0002637', 'HP:0002639', 'HP:0002829', 'HP:0002863', 'HP:0004417', 'HP:0004420', 'HP:0004936', 'HP:0005513', 'HP:0011974', 'HP:0012378', 'HP:0030242']"

Infants with extensive defects show symptoms of the disorder shortly after birth, and the diagnosis is usually made before the age of 1.The following text lists out common signs and symptoms of porencephaly in affected individuals along with a short description of certain terminologies.","['HP:0000238', 'HP:0000482', 'HP:0000483', 'HP:0000501', 'HP:0000519', 'HP:0000540', 'HP:0000545', 'HP:0000568', 'HP:0000577', 'HP:0000622', 'HP:0000646', 'HP:0001123', 'HP:0001136', 'HP:0001249', 'HP:0001250', 'HP:0001257', 'HP:0001269', 'HP:0001272', 'HP:0001342', 'HP:0001878', 'HP:0002076', 'HP:0002132', 'HP:0002140', 'HP:0002273', 'HP:0002301', 'HP:0002352', 'HP:0002451', 'HP:0002539', 'HP:0003236', 'HP:0003487', 'HP:0007209', 'HP:0007663', 'HP:0007676', 'HP:0007894', 'HP:0007957', 'HP:0009918', 'HP:0010636', 'HP:0011496', 'HP:0011500', 'HP:0032046', 'HP:0500087']"
176100,Porphyria cutanea tarda,"Porphyria cutanea tarda (commonly referred to as PCT) is recognized as the most prevalent subtype of porphyritic diseases.The disease is characterized by onycholysis and blistering of the skin in areas that receive higher levels of exposure to sunlight.  The primary cause of this disorder is a deficiency of uroporphyrinogen decarboxylase (UROD), a cytosolic enzyme that is a step in the enzymatic pathway that leads to the synthesis of heme. While a deficiency in this enzyme is the direct cause leading to this disorder, there are a number of both genetic and environmental risk factors that are associated with PCT.Typically, patients who are ultimately diagnosed with PCT first seek treatment following the development of photosensitivities in the form of blisters and erosions on commonly exposed areas of the skin. This is usually observed in the face, hands, forearms, and lower legs. It heals slowly and with scarring. Though blisters are the most common skin manifestations of PCT, other skin manifestations like hyperpigmentation (as if they are getting a tan) and hypertrichosis (mainly on top of the cheeks) also occur. PCT is a chronic condition, with external symptoms often subsiding and recurring as a result of a number of factors.  In addition to the symptomatic manifestation of the disease in the skin, chronic liver problems are extremely common in patients with the sporadic form of PCT.  These include hepatic fibrosis (scarring of the liver), cirrhosis, and inflammation. However, liver problems are less common in patients with the inherited form of the disease. Additionally, patients will often void a wine-red color urine with an increased concentration of uroporphyrin I due to their enzymatic deficiency.","['HP:0000992', 'HP:0001006', 'HP:0001030', 'HP:0001394', 'HP:0001402', 'HP:0001596', 'HP:0001806', 'HP:0002219', 'HP:0005586', 'HP:0100324']"

263700,"Porphyria, congenital erythropoietic","Though expressivity is varied depending on the mutation responsible for decrease in enzyme function, severe cutaneous sensitivity is present in most cases of this Porphyria. An estimated 30–40% of cases are due to the C73R mutation, which decreases stability of the enzyme and results in <1% of its activity. Exposure to long-wave ultraviolet light causes the affected skin to thicken and produce vesicles that are prone to rupture and infection; these secondary infections, along with bone resorption, can lead to disfigurement of the sun-exposed face and extremities.
Enzyme dysfunction prevents the normal production of heme and hemolytic anemia is another common symptom, though a lack of hemolysis in this disease is possible. Porphyrins additionally accumulate in the bone and teeth, resulting in erythrodontia.
When unexpected attacks occur, abdominal pain, as well as vomiting and constipation commonly follow the attacks.

300511,Premature ovarian failure,"On average, the ovaries supply a woman with eggs until age 51, the average age of natural menopause.POF is not the same as a natural menopause, in that the dysfunction of the ovaries, loss of eggs, or removal of the ovaries at a young age is not a normal physiological occurrence.
Infertility is the result of this condition, and is the most discussed problem resulting from it, but there are additional health implications of the problem, and studies are ongoing. For example, osteoporosis (decreased bone density) affects almost all women with POF due to an insufficiency of estrogen. There is also an increased risk of heart disease, hypothyroidism in the form of Hashimoto's thyroiditis, Addison's disease, and other autoimmune disorders.
Hormonally, POF is defined by abnormally low levels of estrogen and high levels of FSH, which demonstrate that the ovaries are no longer responding to circulating FSH by producing estrogen and developing fertile eggs. The ovaries will likely appear shriveled.
The age of onset can be as early as 11 years, or can even exist from birth, but varies widely. If a girl never begins menstruation, it is called primary ovarian failure. The age of 40 was chosen as the cut-off point for a diagnosis of POF. This age was chosen somewhat arbitrarily, as all women's ovaries decline in function over time. However an age needed to be chosen to distinguish usual menopause from the abnormal state of premature menopause. Premature ovarian failure has components to it that distinguish it from normal menopause.
By the age of 40, approximately one percent of women have POF. Women with POF usually experience menopausal symptoms that are more severe than the symptoms found in older menopausal women.","['HP:0000869', 'HP:0008209']"
170100,Prolidase deficiency,"Prolidase deficiency generally becomes evident during infancy, but initial symptoms can first manifest anytime from birth to young adulthood. The condition results in a very diverse set symptoms, the severity of which can vary significantly between patients, depending on the degree to which prolidase activity is hampered by the individual underlying mutation(s) in each case. It is even possible, though rare, for affected individuals to be asymptomatic, in which case the disorder can only be identified through laboratory screening of the prospective patient and/or their extended family.
One of the signature features of PD is the elimination of high quantities of peptides through urine.
In addition, most of those affected exhibit persistent skin lesions (starting from a mild rash) or ulcers, primarily on the legs and feet, the formation of which normally begins during childhood. Clinically, these, among other dermatological issues, represent the most distinguishing and most frequent symptoms. These may never recede, potentially leading to severe infections that can, in the worst case, necessitate amputation.
PD patients exhibit a weak immune system and markedly elevated vulnerability to infections in general, and particularly those of the respiratory system, leading some who suffer from PD to acquire recurrent lung disease. They may also have an enlarged spleen (splenomegaly), and on some occasions the spleen and liver may both be enlarged (hepatosplenomegaly). Photosensitivity and hyperkeratosis have been associated with PD. Abnormal facial characteristics, consisting of pronounced eyes which are spaced far apart (hypertelorism), a high forehead, a compressed bridge of the nose or saddle nose, and a small lower jaw and chin (micrognathia), are also observed in the majority of cases.Those affected by PD can also suffer intellectual disabilities (approx. 75% of recorded cases do) ranging from mild to severe – mental development during childhood may therefore progress more slowly.","['HP:0000294', 'HP:0000316', 'HP:0000347', 'HP:0000365', 'HP:0000370', 'HP:0000444', 'HP:0000457', 'HP:0000505', 'HP:0000508', 'HP:0000520', 'HP:0000670', 'HP:0000958', 'HP:0000962', 'HP:0000963', 'HP:0000967', 'HP:0000982', 'HP:0000989', 'HP:0000992', 'HP:0001007', 'HP:0001166', 'HP:0001231', 'HP:0001249', 'HP:0001263', 'HP:0001744', 'HP:0001873', 'HP:0001903', 'HP:0001939', 'HP:0001999', 'HP:0002099', 'HP:0002162', 'HP:0002205', 'HP:0002211', 'HP:0002230', 'HP:0002240', 'HP:0002715', 'HP:0002719', 'HP:0002725', 'HP:0002857', 'HP:0003196', 'HP:0003272', 'HP:0004349', 'HP:0005280', 'HP:0006528', 'HP:0006532', 'HP:0006579', 'HP:0007473', 'HP:0007489', 'HP:0007598', 'HP:0007703', 'HP:0008065', 'HP:0010669', 'HP:0010783', 'HP:0011220', 'HP:0012786', 'HP:0200034', 'HP:0200042']"
176807,Prostate cancer,"Early prostate cancer usually has no clear symptoms. Sometimes, it does cause symptoms, often similar to those of diseases such as benign prostatic hyperplasia. These include frequent urination, nocturia (increased urination at night), difficulty starting and maintaining a steady stream of urine, hematuria (blood in the urine), and dysuria (painful urination). A study based on the 1998 Patient Care Evaluation in the US found that about a third of patients diagnosed with prostate cancer had one or more such symptoms, while two-thirds had no symptoms.Prostate cancer is associated with urinary dysfunction as the prostate gland surrounds the prostatic urethra. Changes within the gland, therefore, directly affect urinary function. Because the vas deferens deposits seminal fluid into the prostatic urethra, and secretions from the prostate gland itself are included in semen content, prostate cancer may also cause problems with sexual function and performance, such as difficulty achieving erection or painful ejaculation.Metastatic prostate cancer that has spread to other parts of the body can cause additional symptoms. The most common symptom is bone pain, often in the vertebrae (bones of the spine), pelvis, or ribs. Spread of cancer into other bones such as the femur is usually to the proximal or nearby part of the bone. Prostate cancer in the spine can also compress the spinal cord, causing tingling, leg weakness, and urinary and fecal incontinence.",['HP:0012125']

264600,Pseudovaginal perineoscrotal hypospadias,"Individuals with 5-ARD are born with male gonads, including testicles and Wolffian structures. They can have normal male external genitalia, ambiguous genitalia, or normal female genitalia, but usually tend towards a female appearance.
The development of the genital tubercle tissue (which by week 9 of a fetus' gestation becomes either a clitoris or a penis) tends towards a size qualifying it as an ambiguous macroclitoris/micropenis (large clitoris/small penis), and the urethra may attach to the phallus.
If the condition has not already been diagnosed, it usually becomes apparent at puberty around age twelve with primary amenorrhoea and virilization. This may include descending of the testes, hirsutism (facial/body hair considered normal in males – not to be confused with hypertrichosis), deepening of the voice, and enlargement of the clitoris into what would then be classed as a penis.
In adulthood, individuals do not experience male-pattern baldness. As dihydrotestosterone (DHT) is a far more potent androgen than testosterone alone, virilization in those lacking DHT may be absent or reduced compared to males with functional 5-AR. It is hypothesized that rising testosterone levels at the start of puberty are able to generate sufficient levels of DHT either by the action of 5α-reductase type I (active in the adult liver, non-genital skin and some brain areas) or through the expression of low levels of 5α-reductase type II in the testes.
5-ARD is associated with an increased risk of cryptorchidism and testicular cancer.","['HP:0000028', 'HP:0000033', 'HP:0000046', 'HP:0000048', 'HP:0000051', 'HP:0000054', 'HP:0000062', 'HP:0000144', 'HP:0000818', 'HP:0001595', 'HP:0001608', 'HP:0001939', 'HP:0008736', 'HP:0100779']"
264800,Pseudoxanthoma elasticum,"Usually, pseudoxanthoma elasticum affects the skin first, often in childhood or early adolescence. Small, yellowish papular lesions form and cutaneous laxity mainly affect the neck, axillae (armpits), groin, and flexural creases (the inside parts of the elbows and knees). Skin may become lax and redundant. Many individuals have ""oblique mental creases"" (horizontal grooves of the chin)PXE first affects the retina through a dimpling of the Bruch membrane (a thin membrane separating the blood vessel-rich layer from the pigmented layer of the retina), that is only visible during ophthalmologic examinations.  This is called peau d'orange (a French term meaning ""skin of the orange""). Eventually the mineralization of the elastic fibers in the Bruch membrane create cracks called angioid streaks that radiate out from the optic nerve. Angioid streaks themselves do not cause distortion of vision, even if they cross into the foveal area. This symptom is present in almost all PXE patients and is usually noticed a few years after the onset of cutaneous lesions. These cracks may allow small blood vessels that were originally held back by Bruch's membrane to penetrate the retina. These blood vessels sometimes leak, and these retinal hemorrhages may lead to the loss of central vision. Vision loss is a major issue in many PXE patients.PXE may affect the gastrointestinal and cardiovascular systems. Gastrointestinal bleeding is a rare symptom and usually involved bleeding from the stomach. In the circulatory system, intermittent claudication, a condition in which cramping pain in the leg is induced by exercise, is a prominent feature. At later stages, coronary artery disease may develop, leading to angina and myocardial infarction (heart attack) may occur. Cerebral ischemia in PXE is caused by small vessel occlusive disease.
Other rare neurological complications may include intracranial aneurysms, subarachnoid and intracerebral hemorrhages.","['HP:0000083', 'HP:0000121', 'HP:0000153', 'HP:0000218', 'HP:0000474', 'HP:0000488', 'HP:0000505', 'HP:0000545', 'HP:0000573', 'HP:0000592', 'HP:0000608', 'HP:0000765', 'HP:0000821', 'HP:0000822', 'HP:0000951', 'HP:0000973', 'HP:0000974', 'HP:0000978', 'HP:0000988', 'HP:0000989', 'HP:0001012', 'HP:0001034', 'HP:0001061', 'HP:0001065', 'HP:0001102', 'HP:0001297', 'HP:0001482', 'HP:0001634', 'HP:0001635', 'HP:0001645', 'HP:0001677', 'HP:0001681', 'HP:0001718', 'HP:0001723', 'HP:0001872', 'HP:0002172', 'HP:0002239', 'HP:0002514', 'HP:0002617', 'HP:0002621', 'HP:0002650', 'HP:0004306', 'HP:0004374', 'HP:0004417', 'HP:0004943', 'HP:0005692', 'HP:0007392', 'HP:0007663', 'HP:0011506', 'HP:0011510', 'HP:0012426', 'HP:0012508', 'HP:0025115', 'HP:0025507', 'HP:0025533', 'HP:0030680', 'HP:0032553', 'HP:0045051', 'HP:0100545', 'HP:0100585', 'HP:0100659', 'HP:0100679', 'HP:0100817']"

265800,Pycnodysostosis,"Pycnodysostosis causes the bones to be abnormally dense (osteopetrosis); the last bones of the fingers (the distal phalanges) to be unusually short; and delays the normal closure of the connections (sutures) of the skull bones in infancy, so that the ""soft spot"" (fontanelle) on top of the head remains widely open.Those with the syndrome have brittle bones which easily break, especially in the legs and feet. The jaw and collar bone (clavicle) are also particularly prone to fractures.
Other abnormalities involve the head and face, teeth, collar bones, skin, and nails. The front and back of the head are prominent. Within the open sutures of the skull, there may be many small bones (called wormian bones). The midface is less full than usual. The nose is prominent. The jaw can be small. The palate is narrow and grooved. The baby teeth are late coming in and may be lost much later than usual. The permanent teeth can also be slow to appear. The permanent teeth are commonly irregular and teeth may be missing (hypodontia). The collar bones are often underdeveloped and malformed. The skin over the back of the fingers is very wrinkled. The nails are flat, grooved, and dysplastic. It seems that macrocephaly, prominent nose, and obtuse mandibular angle are the specific manifestations of this disorder. Pycnodysostosis also causes problems that may become evident with time. Aside from the broken bones, the distal phalanges and the collar bone can undergo slow progressive deterioration. Vertebral defects may permit the spine to curve laterally resulting in scoliosis. The dental problems often require orthodontic care and cavities are common.","['HP:0000164', 'HP:0000189', 'HP:0000238', 'HP:0000248', 'HP:0000269', 'HP:0000271', 'HP:0000272', 'HP:0000347', 'HP:0000348', 'HP:0000448', 'HP:0000520', 'HP:0000592', 'HP:0000668', 'HP:0000670', 'HP:0000680', 'HP:0000684', 'HP:0000696', 'HP:0000765', 'HP:0000774', 'HP:0000889', 'HP:0000924', 'HP:0000925', 'HP:0000951', 'HP:0001156', 'HP:0001231', 'HP:0001597', 'HP:0001744', 'HP:0001807', 'HP:0001831', 'HP:0001903', 'HP:0002007', 'HP:0002240', 'HP:0002644', 'HP:0002645', 'HP:0002650', 'HP:0002652', 'HP:0002653', 'HP:0002688', 'HP:0002754', 'HP:0002757', 'HP:0002793', 'HP:0002797', 'HP:0002808', 'HP:0003302', 'HP:0003304', 'HP:0003307', 'HP:0003468', 'HP:0004322', 'HP:0004474', 'HP:0005930', 'HP:0006335', 'HP:0006482', 'HP:0009106', 'HP:0009839', 'HP:0009882', 'HP:0011001', 'HP:0011800', 'HP:0100543']"

312170,Pyruvate dehydrogenase deficiency,"PDCD is generally presented in one of two forms. The metabolic form appears as lactic acidosis. The neurological form of PDCD contributes to hypotonia, poor feeding, lethargy and structural abnormalities in the brain.  Patients may develop seizures and/or neuropathological spasms. These presentations of the disease usually progress to mental retardation, microcephaly, blindness, and spasticity.Females with residual pyruvate dehydrogenase activity will have no uncontrollable systemic lactic acidosis and few, if any, neurological symptoms. Conversely, females with little to no enzyme activity will have major structural brain abnormalities and atrophy.  Males with mutations that abolish, or almost abolish, enzyme activity presumably die in utero because brain cells are not able to generate enough ATP to be functionally viable. It is expected that most cases will be of mild severity and have a clinical presentation involving lactic acidosis. Male infants that reach full term display more severe symptoms than females, and exhibit high mortality within the first few years of life Prenatal onset may present with non-specific signs such as low Apgar scores and small for gestational age. These cases display hydrocephalus, and thinning of the cerebral tissue. Metabolic disturbances may also be considered with poor feeding and lethargy out of proportion to a mild viral illness, and especially after bacterial infection has been ruled out. PDH activity may be enhanced by exercise, phenylbutyrate and dichloroacetate.The clinical presentation of congenital PDH deficiency is typically characterized by heterogenous neurological features that usually appear within the first year of life. In addition, patients usually show severe hyperventillation due to profound metabolic acidosis mostly related to lactic acidosis. Metabolic acidosis in these patients is usually refractory to correction with bicarbonate.The following table lists common symptoms of pyruvate dehydrogenase deficiency.","['HP:0000252', 'HP:0000343', 'HP:0000431', 'HP:0000454', 'HP:0000463', 'HP:0000496', 'HP:0000508', 'HP:0001249', 'HP:0001250', 'HP:0001252', 'HP:0001254', 'HP:0001263', 'HP:0001266', 'HP:0001274', 'HP:0001290', 'HP:0001332', 'HP:0001518', 'HP:0001999', 'HP:0002007', 'HP:0002059', 'HP:0002119', 'HP:0002131', 'HP:0002151', 'HP:0002490', 'HP:0002872', 'HP:0002928', 'HP:0003348', 'HP:0004900', 'HP:0004925', 'HP:0006799', 'HP:0025356']"
266200,Pyruvate kinase deficiency,"Symptoms can be extremely varied among those suffering from pyruvate kinase deficiency.

Mild to severe hemolytic Anemia
Cholecystolithiasis
Tachycardia
Hemochromatosis
Icteric sclera
Splenomegaly
Leg ulcers
Jaundice
Fatigue
Shortness of breathThe level of 2,3-bisphosphoglycerate is elevated: 1,3-bisphosphoglycerate, a precursor of phosphoenolpyruvate which is the substrate for Pyruvate kinase, is increased and so the Luebering-Rapoport pathway is overactivated.

A skin abnormality known as acanthosis nigricans, which involves a discoloration (hyperpigmentation) and “velvety” thickening (hyperkeratosis) of the skin around skin fold regions of the neck, groin and under arms is also a common symptom. Symptoms will negatively impact the daily life of the patient, and will persist until treated.
Minor symptoms may include an enlargement of the genitalia and precocious puberty and a deficiency or absence of fat tissue.

268210,Rhabdomyosarcoma,"RMS can occur in almost any soft-tissue site in the body; the most common primary sites are genitourinary (24%), parameningeal (16%), extremity (19%), orbit (9%), other head and neck (10%), and miscellaneous other sites (22%). RMS often presents as a mass, but signs and symptoms can vary widely depending on the site of the primary tumor. Genitourinary tumors may present with hematuria, urinary tract obstruction, and/or a scrotal or vaginal mass. Tumors that arise in the retroperitoneum and mediastinum can become quite large before producing signs and symptoms. Parameningeal tumors may present with cranial nerve dysfunction, symptoms of sinusitis, ear discharge, headaches, and facial pain. Orbital tumors often present with orbital swelling and proptosis. Extremity tumors generally present as a rapidly enlarging, firm mass in the relevant tissue. The cancer's prevalence in the head, face, and neck will often allow for earlier signs of the disease simply due to the obvious nature of tumors in these locations. Despite the varying presentation and typically aggressive nature of the disease, RMS has the potential to be diagnosed and treated early. The fourth IRSG study found that 23% of patients were diagnosed in time for a complete resection of their cancer, and 15% had resection with only minimal remnants of the diseased cells.",['HP:0006743']

Syndactyly- condition in which two or more fingers (or toes) are joined together; the joining can involve the bones or just the skin between the fingers
Clinodactyly- curving of the fifth finger (little finger) towards the fourth finger (ring finger) due to the underdevelopment of the middle bone in the fifth finger
Elbow/knee flexion contractures- an inability to fully straighten the arm or leg
Cleft lip- the presence of one or two vertical fissures in the upper lip; can be on one side (unilateral) or on both sides (bilateral)
Cleft palate- opening in the roof of the mouth
Premaxillary protrusion- upper part of the mouth sticks out farther than the lower part of the mouth
Micrognathia- small chin
Microbrachycephaly- smaller than normal head size
Malar hypoplasia- underdevelopment of the cheek bones
Downslanting palpebral fissures- the outer corners of the eyes point downwards
Ocular hypertelorism- unusually wide-set eyes
Exophthalmos- a protruding eyeball
Corneal clouding- clouding of the front-most part of the eye
Hypoplastic nasal alae- narrowing of the nostrils that can decrease the width of the nasal base
Beaked nose- a nose with a prominent bridge that gives it the appearance of being curved
Ear malformations

Neurological damage may result in absent tendon reflexes (areflexia), some distal sensory loss and decreased excitability of muscles to galvanic and faradic stimulation. Progressive muscle wasting results in weakness of distal limb muscles (especially the peronei), gait ataxia, pes cavus, postural tremors and static tremor of the upper limbs, kyphoscoliosis, and foot deformity.These symptoms frequently translate into delayed onset of ability to walk, loss of coordination and balance, foot drop, and foot-bone deformities. They are usually first observed during infancy or early childhood, and slowly progress until about age 30, at which point progression may stop in some individuals, or symptoms may continue to slowly progress.","['HP:0001265', 'HP:0001270', 'HP:0001284', 'HP:0001288', 'HP:0001761', 'HP:0001765', 'HP:0002066', 'HP:0002345', 'HP:0002460', 'HP:0002715', 'HP:0002751', 'HP:0002936', 'HP:0003380', 'HP:0003382', 'HP:0003383', 'HP:0003431', 'HP:0003481', 'HP:0003693', 'HP:0007351', 'HP:0100022']"

Bilateral symmetric tetraphocomelia- a birth defect in which the hands and feet are attached to shortened arms and legs
Prenatal growth retardation
Hypomelia (hypoplasia)- the incomplete development of a tissue or organ; less drastic than aplasia, which is no development at all
Oligodactyly- fewer than normal number of fingers or toes
Thumb aplasia- the absence of a thumb
Syndactyly- condition in which two or more fingers (or toes) are joined together; the joining can involve the bones or just the skin between the fingers
Clinodactyly- curving of the fifth finger (little finger) towards the fourth finger (ring finger) due to the underdevelopment of the middle bone in the fifth finger
Elbow/knee flexion contractures- an inability to fully straighten the arm or leg
Cleft lip- the presence of one or two vertical fissures in the upper lip; can be on one side (unilateral) or on both sides (bilateral)
Cleft palate- opening in the roof of the mouth
Premaxillary protrusion- upper part of the mouth sticks out farther than the lower part of the mouth
Micrognathia- small chin
Microbrachycephaly- smaller than normal head size
Malar hypoplasia- underdevelopment of the cheek bones
Downslanting palpebral fissures- the outer corners of the eyes point downwards
Ocular hypertelorism- unusually wide-set eyes
Exophthalmos- a protruding eyeball
Corneal clouding- clouding of the front-most part of the eye
Hypoplastic nasal alae- narrowing of the nostrils that can decrease the width of the nasal base
Beaked nose- a nose with a prominent bridge that gives it the appearance of being curved
Ear malformations
Intellectual disability

260400,Shwachman–Bodian–Diamond syndrome,"The syndrome shows a wide range of abnormalities and symptoms. The main characteristics of the syndrome are exocrine pancreatic dysfunction, hematologic abnormalities and growth retardation. Only the first two of these are included in the clinical diagnostic criteria.
Hematologic abnormalities: neutropenia may be intermittent or persistent and is the most common hematological finding. Low neutrophil counts leave patients at risk of developing severe recurrent infections that may be life-threatening. Anemia (low red blood cell counts) and thrombocytopenia (low platelet counts) may also occur. Bone marrow is typically hypocellular, with maturation arrest in the myeloid lineages that give rise to neutrophils, macrophages, platelets and red blood cells. Patients may also develop progressive marrow failure or transform to acute myelogenous leukemia.
Exocrine pancreatic dysfunction: Pancreatic exocrine insufficiency arises due to a lack of acinar cells that produce digestive enzymes. These are extensively depleted and replaced by fat. A lack of pancreatic digestive enzymes leaves patients unable to digest and absorb fat. However, pancreatic status may improve with age in some patients.
Growth retardation: More than 50% of patients are below the third percentile for height, and short stature appears to be unrelated to nutritional status. Other skeletal abnormalities include metaphyseal dysostosis (45% of patients), thoracic dystrophy (rib cage abnormalities in 46% of patients) and costochondral thickening (shortened ribs with flared ends in 32% of patients). Skeletal problems are one of the most variable components of SDS, with 50% affected siblings from the same family discordant for clinical presentation or type of abnormality.

Often small for gestational age (SGA) at birth (birth weight less than 2.8 kg)
Feeding problems: the baby is uninterested in feeding and takes only small amounts with difficulty
Hypoglycemia
Excessive sweating as a baby, especially at night, and a greyness or pallor of the skin. This may be a symptom of hypoglycemia
Triangular face with a small jaw and a pointed chin that tends to lessen slightly with age. The mouth tends to curve down
A blue tinge to the whites of the eyes in younger children
Head circumference may be of normal size and disproportionate to a small body size
Wide and late-closing fontanelle
Clinodactyly
Body asymmetry: one side of the body grows more slowly than the other
Continued poor growth with no ""catch up"" into the normal centile lines on growth chart
Precocious puberty (occasionally)
Low muscle tone
Gastroesophageal reflux disease
A striking lack of subcutaneous fat

210250,Sitosterolemia,"Sitosterolemia may share several clinical characteristics with the well-characterized  familial hypercholesterolemia (FH), such as the development of tendon xanthomas in the first 10 years of life and the development of premature atherosclerosis. However, in contrast to FH patients, sitosterolemia patients usually have normal to moderately elevated total sterol levels and very high levels of plant sterols (sitosterol, campesterol, stigmasterol, avenosterol) and 5α-saturated stanols in their plasma. Plasma sitosterol levels in sitosterolemia patients are 10–25 times higher than in normal individuals (8–60 mg/dl). Not all patients with sitosterolemia have tendon xanthomas, thus absence of this should not be used to exclude this diagnosis.
Xanthomas may appear at any age, even in childhood. These may be present as subcutaneous xanthomas on the buttocks in children or in usual locations (e.g., Achilles tendon, extensor tendons of the hand) in children and adults. Xanthelasma and corneal arcus are less common. Decreased range of motion with possible redness, swelling, and warmth of joints due to arthritis may be present. In addition, sitosterolemia patients may develop hemolytic episodes and splenomegaly. 
Untreated, the condition causes a significant increase in morbidity and mortality. Coronary heart disease and its inherent health consequences are the primary causes of illness and premature death in untreated patients.
This condition is suspected to result in liver dysfunction and cirrhosis, in the context of sitosterolemia, is reported",[]

182290,Smith–Magenis syndrome,"Facial features of children with Smith–Magenis syndrome include a broad and square face, deep-set eyes, large cheeks, and a prominent jaw, as well as a flat nose bridge (in the young child; as the child ages it becomes more ski-jump shaped). Eyes tend to be deep-set and appear close together there is also a slant upwards.  Eyebrows are heavy with lateral extension. The mouth is the most noticeable feature, both upper and lower lips are full, the mouth is wide.  The mouth curves downwards and the upper lip curves outwards, due to a fleshy philtrum. These facial features become more noticeable as the individual ages, as Mandible growth outstrips that of the maxilla leading to a clear midface hypoplasia. There is also a mild brachycephaly.Disrupted sleep patterns are characteristic of Smith–Magenis syndrome, typically beginning early in life. Affected people may be very sleepy during the day, but have trouble falling asleep and awaken several times each night, due to an inverted circadian rhythm of melatonin.People with Smith–Magenis syndrome have engaging personalities, but all also have a lot of behavioral problems. These behavioral problems include frequent temper tantrums, meltdowns and outbursts, aggression, anger, fidgeting, compulsive behavior, anxiety, impulsiveness, and difficulty paying attention. Self-harm, including biting, hitting, head banging, and skin picking, is very common. Repetitive self-hugging is a behavioral trait that may be unique to Smith–Magenis syndrome. People with this condition may also compulsively lick their fingers and flip pages of books and magazines (a behavior known as ""lick and flip""), as well as possessing an impressive ability to recall a wide range of small details about people or subject-specific trivia.
Other symptoms can include short stature, abnormal curvature of the spine (scoliosis), reduced sensitivity to pain and temperature, and a hoarse voice. Some people with this disorder have ear abnormalities that lead to hearing loss. Affected individuals may have eye abnormalities that cause nearsightedness (myopia), strabismus, and other problems with vision.

117550,Sotos syndrome,"This syndrome is characterized by overgrowth and advanced bone age. Affected individuals are dysmorphic, with macrodolichocephaly, downslanting palpebral fissures and a pointed chin. The facial appearance is most notable in early childhood. Affected infants and children tend to grow quickly; they are significantly taller than their siblings and peers, and have an unusually large skull and large head. Adult height is usually in the normal range, although Broc Brown has the condition and was named the world's tallest teenager.  As of late 2016, he was 7'8"" and still growing.Individuals with Sotos syndrome often have intellectual impairment, and most also display autistic traits. Frequent behavioral impairments include attention deficit hyperactivity disorder (ADHD), phobias, obsessive compulsive disorder, tantrums, and impulsive behaviors (impulse control disorder). Problems with speech and language are also common. Affected individuals may often have stuttering, difficulty with sound production, or a monotone voice. Additionally, weak muscle tone (hypotonia) may delay other aspects of early development, particularly motor skills such as sitting and crawling.
Other signs include scoliosis, seizures, heart or kidney defects, hearing loss, and problems with vision. Some infants with this disorder experience jaundice and poor feeding. A small number of patients with Sotos syndrome have developed cancer, most often in childhood, but no single form of cancer has been associated with this condition. It remains uncertain whether Sotos syndrome increases the risk of specific types of cancer. If persons with this disorder have any increased cancer risk, their risk is only slightly greater than that of the general population.","['HP:0000077', 'HP:0000098', 'HP:0000189', 'HP:0000218', 'HP:0000256', 'HP:0000268', 'HP:0000303', 'HP:0000307', 'HP:0000316', 'HP:0000388', 'HP:0000405', 'HP:0000486', 'HP:0000494', 'HP:0000540', 'HP:0000639', 'HP:0000708', 'HP:0001176', 'HP:0001249', 'HP:0001250', 'HP:0001263', 'HP:0001319', 'HP:0001338', 'HP:0001347', 'HP:0001388', 'HP:0001629', 'HP:0001631', 'HP:0001643', 'HP:0001763', 'HP:0001792', 'HP:0001833', 'HP:0001952', 'HP:0002007', 'HP:0002119', 'HP:0002280', 'HP:0002370', 'HP:0002389', 'HP:0002474', 'HP:0002650', 'HP:0002664', 'HP:0002667', 'HP:0002705', 'HP:0002857', 'HP:0005616', 'HP:0006288', 'HP:0009890']"
270700,Spastic paraplegia 15,"Symptoms depend on the type of HSP inherited. The main feature of the disease is progressive spasticity in the lower limbs due to pyramidal tract dysfunction. This also results in brisk reflexes, extensor plantar reflexes, muscle weakness, and variable bladder disturbances. Furthermore, among the core symptoms of HSP are also included abnormal gait and difficulty in walking, decreased vibratory sense at the ankles, and paresthesia.
Individuals with HSP can experience extreme fatigue associated with central nervous system and neuromuscular disorders, which can be disabling. Initial symptoms are typically difficulty with balance, stubbing the toe or stumbling. Symptoms of HSP may begin at any age, from infancy to older than 60 years. If symptoms begin during the teenage years or later, then spastic gait disturbance usually progresses over many years. Canes, walkers, and wheelchairs may eventually be required, although some people never require assistance devices. Disability has been described as progressing more rapidly in adult onset forms.More specifically, patients with the autosomal dominant pure form of HSP reveal normal facial and extraocular movement. Although jaw jerk may be brisk in older subjects, there is no speech disturbance or difficulty of swallowing. Upper extremity muscle tone and strength are normal. In the lower extremities, muscle tone is increased at the hamstrings, quadriceps and ankles. Weakness is most notable at the iliopsoas, tibialis anterior, and to a lesser extent, hamstring muscles.
In the complex form of the disorder, additional symptoms are present. These include: peripheral neuropathy, amyotrophy, ataxia, intellectual disability, ichthyosis, epilepsy, optic neuropathy, dementia, deafness, or problems with speech, swallowing or breathing.Anita Harding classified the HSP in a pure and complicated form. Pure HSP presents with spasticity in the lower limbs, associated with neurogenic bladder disturbance as well as lack of vibration sensitivity (pallhypesthesia). On the other hand, HSP is classified as complex when lower limb spasticity is combined with any additional neurological symptom.
This classification is subjective and patients with complex HSPs are sometimes diagnosed as having cerebellar ataxia with spasticity, mental retardation (with spasticity), or  leukodystrophy. Some of the genes listed below have been described in other diseases than HSP before. Therefore, some key genes overlap with other disease groups.","['HP:0000009', 'HP:0000012', 'HP:0000020', 'HP:0000118', 'HP:0000496', 'HP:0000505', 'HP:0000546', 'HP:0000580', 'HP:0000608', 'HP:0000639', 'HP:0000708', 'HP:0000709', 'HP:0000720', 'HP:0000726', 'HP:0000819', 'HP:0001152', 'HP:0001249', 'HP:0001250', 'HP:0001251', 'HP:0001257', 'HP:0001258', 'HP:0001260', 'HP:0001288', 'HP:0001317', 'HP:0001324', 'HP:0001328', 'HP:0001347', 'HP:0001761', 'HP:0002061', 'HP:0002064', 'HP:0002071', 'HP:0002079', 'HP:0002145', 'HP:0002169', 'HP:0002378', 'HP:0002395', 'HP:0002495', 'HP:0002500', 'HP:0002607', 'HP:0002839', 'HP:0003477', 'HP:0003484', 'HP:0003487', 'HP:0003693', 'HP:0006986', 'HP:0007024', 'HP:0007108', 'HP:0007340', 'HP:0007663', 'HP:0008969', 'HP:0010550', 'HP:0012045', 'HP:0030506', 'HP:0030892', 'HP:0100543']"

137215,Stomach cancer,"Stomach cancer is often either asymptomatic (producing no noticeable symptoms) or it may cause only nonspecific symptoms (symptoms that may also be present in other related or unrelated disorders) in its early stages. By the time symptoms occur, the cancer has often reached an advanced stage (see below) and may have metastasized (spread to other, perhaps distant, parts of the body), which is one of the main reasons for its relatively poor prognosis. Stomach cancer can cause the following signs and symptoms:
Early cancers may be associated with indigestion or a burning sensation (heartburn). However, fewer than 1 in every 50 people referred for endoscopy due to indigestion has cancer. Abdominal discomfort and loss of appetite, especially for meat, can occur.
Gastric cancers that have enlarged and invaded normal tissue can cause weakness, fatigue, bloating of the stomach after meals, abdominal pain in the upper abdomen, nausea and occasional vomiting, diarrhea or constipation. Further enlargement may cause weight loss or bleeding with vomiting blood or having blood in the stool, the latter apparent as black discolouration (melena) and sometimes leading to anemia. Dysphagia suggests a tumour in the cardia or extension of the gastric tumour into the esophagus.
These can be symptoms of other problems such as a stomach virus, gastric ulcer, or tropical sprue.","['HP:0000175', 'HP:0000204', 'HP:0002582', 'HP:0002664', 'HP:0012126']"

The most constant features seen are developmental delay, hypotonia and intellectual disability. Nearly half of patients seen manifest ataxia, behavior problems, seizures, and hyporeflexia.The age of onset ranges from newborn period to 25 years. Problems unique to neonates can include prematurity, lethargy, decreased sucking, respiratory difficulty and hypoglycemia. Gastrointestinal symptoms have been seen primarily in this 
population and are usually related to increased feeding.
Ocular problems related to the disorder include strabismus, nystagmus, retinitis, disc pallor, and oculomotor apraxia.Over half of the patients with SSADH deficiency have seizures. These include absence, tonic clonic, and convulsive status epilepticus. It is unclear whether decreased levels of GABA or elevated levels of GHB are responsible for these seizures but alterations in these neurotransmitters and their receptor binding or neurotransmitter transport is hypothesized to play a role in the pathogenesis of the seizures in this population.Symptoms associated with SSADH may be mild, moderate or severe and often vary greatly from case to case.

601104,"Supranuclear palsy, progressive","The initial symptoms in two-thirds of cases are loss of balance, lunging forward when mobilizing, fast walking, bumping into objects or people, and falls. Dementia symptoms are also initially seen in about one in five cases.Other common early symptoms are changes in personality, general slowing of movement, and visual symptoms. The most common behavioural  symptoms in patients with PSP include  apathy, disinhibition, anxiety, and dysphoria.Later symptoms and signs are dementia (typically including loss of inhibition and ability to organize information), slurring of speech, difficulty swallowing, and difficulty moving the eyes, particularly in the vertical direction.  The latter accounts for some of the falls experienced by these patients, as they are unable to look up or down.
Some of the other signs are poor eyelid function, contracture of the facial muscles, a backward tilt of the head with stiffening of the neck muscles, sleep disruption, urinary incontinence, and constipation.
The visual symptoms are of particular importance in the diagnosis of this disorder.  Patients typically complain of difficulty reading due to the inability to look down well.  Notably, the ophthalmoparesis experienced by these patients mainly concerns voluntary eye movement and the inability to make vertical saccades, which is often worse with downward saccades.  Patients tend to have difficulty looking down (a downgaze palsy) followed by the addition of an upgaze palsy. This vertical gaze paresis will correct when the examiner passively rolls the patient's head up and down as part of a test for the oculocephalic reflex.  Involuntary eye movement, as elicited by Bell's phenomenon, for instance, may be closer to normal. On close inspection, eye movements called ""square-wave jerks"" may be visible when the patient fixes at distance. These are fine movements, that can be mistaken for nystagmus, except that they are saccadic in nature, with no smooth phase. Although healthy individuals also make square-wave jerk movements, PSP patients make slower square-wave jerk movements, with smaller vertical components. Assessment of these square-wave jerks and diminished vertical saccades is especially useful for diagnosing progressive supranuclear palsy, because these movements set PSP patients apart from other parkinsonian patients. Difficulties with convergence (convergence insufficiency), where the eyes come closer together while focusing on something near, like the pages of a book, is typical.  Because the eyes have trouble coming together to focus at short distances, the patient may complain of diplopia (double vision) when reading.
A characteristic facial appearance known as “procerus sign”, with a wide-eye stare, furrowing of forehead with a frowning expression and deepening of other facial creases is diagnostic of PSP.Cardinal manifestations:

A very low count (<10,000 per μl) may result in the spontaneous formation of hematomas (blood masses) in the mouth or on other mucous membranes. Bleeding time from minor lacerations or abrasions is usually prolonged.
Serious and possibly fatal complications due to extremely low counts (<5,000 per μl) include subarachnoid or intracerebral hemorrhage (bleeding inside the skull or brain), lower gastrointestinal bleeding or other internal bleeding.

601005,Timothy syndrome,"The most striking sign of Timothy syndrome is the co-occurrence of both syndactyly (about 0.03% of births) and long QT syndrome (1% per year) in a single patient. Other common symptoms include cardiac arrhythmia (94%), heart malformations (59%), and autism or an autism spectrum disorder (80% who survive long enough for evaluation). Facial dysmorphologies such as flattened noses also occur in about half of patients. Children with this disorder have small teeth, which due to poor enamel coating, are prone to dental cavities and often require removal. The average age of death due to complications of these symptoms is 2.5 years.Atypical Timothy syndrome has largely the same symptoms as the classical form. Differences in the atypical form are the lack of syndactyly, the presence of musculoskeletal problems (particularly hyperflexible joints), and atrial fibrillation. Patients with atypical Timothy syndrome also have more facial deformities, including protruding foreheads and tongues. Finally, one patient with atypical Timothy syndrome had a body development discrepancy wherein her upper body was normally developed (that of a 6-year-old) while her lower half resembled a 2- or 3-year-old.Children with Timothy syndrome tend to be born via caesarean section due to fetal distress.","['HP:0000219', 'HP:0000311', 'HP:0000691', 'HP:0000717', 'HP:0000821', 'HP:0001159', 'HP:0001249', 'HP:0001250', 'HP:0001263', 'HP:0001290', 'HP:0001629', 'HP:0001636', 'HP:0001640', 'HP:0001643', 'HP:0001655', 'HP:0001657', 'HP:0001662', 'HP:0001943', 'HP:0002090', 'HP:0002719', 'HP:0002901', 'HP:0005280', 'HP:0012387', 'HP:0012725']"

606003,Transaldolase deficiency,"The leading symptoms of Transaldolase Deficiency are coagulopathy, thrombocytopenia, hepatosplenomegaly, hepatic fibrosis and dysmorphic features. The dysmorphic features can include antimongoloid slant, low-set ears, and cutis laxa. Those affected by this disease have abnormal polyol concentrations in urine and other bodily fluids, this can determined by an abnormal liver function tests.With transaldolase deficiency there is a buildup of sedoheptulose 7-phosphate (it is increased six to sevenfold in the blood compared to normal), which decreases the change of ribose 5-phosphate into glucose 6-phosphate. This reaction is important in releasing NADPH. Reduced glutathione is essential for regulation of Mitochondrial membrane permeability and depends on the NADPH generated from the pentose phosphate pathway to be regenerated from oxidized glutathione. Transaldolase plays an important role in male fertility; this is because it maintains the mitochondrial transmembrane potential and its role in the release NADPH. Therefore, transaldolase deficiency decreases the mobility of spermatozoa and lowers male fertility.Liver cirrhosis is associated with increased apoptosis of hepatocytes and transaldolase is a regulator in apoptosis signaling processing – therefore transaldolase deficiency can result in liver cirrhosis.","['HP:0000056', 'HP:0000077', 'HP:0000154', 'HP:0000233', 'HP:0000260', 'HP:0000322', 'HP:0000325', 'HP:0000369', 'HP:0000470', 'HP:0000664', 'HP:0000969', 'HP:0001009', 'HP:0001263', 'HP:0001394', 'HP:0001395', 'HP:0001410', 'HP:0001413', 'HP:0001433', 'HP:0001508', 'HP:0001511', 'HP:0001518', 'HP:0001562', 'HP:0001629', 'HP:0001631', 'HP:0001643', 'HP:0001655', 'HP:0001680', 'HP:0001744', 'HP:0001789', 'HP:0001873', 'HP:0001876', 'HP:0001903', 'HP:0001999', 'HP:0002002', 'HP:0002033', 'HP:0002099', 'HP:0002240', 'HP:0002795', 'HP:0005280', 'HP:0008665', 'HP:0010903', 'HP:0012202', 'HP:0100678', 'HP:0200128']"

613229,Trichotillomania,"Trichotillomania is usually confined to one or two sites, but can involve multiple sites. The scalp is the most common pulling site, followed by the eyebrows, eyelashes, face, arms, and legs. Some less common areas include the pubic area, underarms, beard, and chest. The classic presentation is the ""Friar Tuck"" form of vertex and crown alopecia.  Children are less likely to pull from areas other than the scalp.People who suffer from trichotillomania often pull only one hair at a time and these hair-pulling episodes can last for hours at a time. Trichotillomania can go into remission-like states where the individual may not experience the urge to ""pull"" for days, weeks, months, and even years.Individuals with trichotillomania exhibit hair of differing lengths; some are broken hairs with blunt ends, some new growth with tapered ends, some broken mid-shaft, or some uneven stubble.  Scaling on the scalp is not present, overall hair density is normal, and a hair pull test is negative (the hair does not pull out easily).  Hair is often pulled out leaving an unusual shape. Individuals with trichotillomania may be secretive or shameful of the hair pulling behavior.An additional psychological effect can be low self-esteem, often associated with being shunned by peers and the fear of socializing, due to appearance and negative attention they may receive.  Some people with trichotillomania wear hats, wigs, false eyelashes, eyebrow pencil, or style their hair in an effort to avoid such attention. There seems to be a strong stress-related component. In low-stress environments, some exhibit no symptoms (known as ""pulling"") whatsoever. This ""pulling"" often resumes upon leaving this environment. Some individuals with trichotillomania may feel they are the only person with this problem due to low rates of reporting.For some people, trichotillomania is a mild problem, merely a frustration. But for many, shame and embarrassment about hair pulling causes painful isolation and results in a great deal of emotional distress, placing them at risk for a co-occurring psychiatric disorder, such as a mood or anxiety disorder. Hair pulling can lead to great tension and strained relationships with family members and friends. Family members may need professional help in coping with this problem.Other medical complications include infection, permanent loss of hair, repetitive stress injury, carpal tunnel syndrome, and gastrointestinal obstruction as a result of trichophagia. In trichophagia, people with trichotillomania also ingest the hair that they pull; in extreme (and rare) cases this can lead to a hair ball (trichobezoar). Rapunzel syndrome, an extreme form of trichobezoar in which the ""tail"" of the hair ball extends into the intestines, can be fatal if misdiagnosed.Environment is a large factor which affects hair pulling. Sedentary activities such as being in a relaxed environment are conducive to hair pulling. A common example of a sedentary activity promoting hair pulling is lying in a bed while trying to rest or fall asleep. An extreme example of automatic trichotillomania is found when some patients have been observed to pull their hair out while asleep. This is called sleep-isolated trichotillomania.","['HP:0000722', 'HP:0001006', 'HP:0001596', 'HP:0012167']"

Individuals with this condition do not have any physical symptoms, and they typically appear healthy.The condition seems to be more common in women than men, for unknown reasons.

In women, symptoms may worsen just before and during menstrual periods, after taking oral contraceptives, and around menopause.The odor seems to vary depending on many known factors, including diet, hormonal changes, stress level, amount of sweat, other odors in the space, and the observer's sense of smell.","['HP:0000716', 'HP:0000822', 'HP:0001649', 'HP:0001744', 'HP:0001875', 'HP:0001903', 'HP:0003614', 'HP:0006532']"
275900,Troyer syndrome,"Symptoms depend on the type of HSP inherited. The main feature of the disease is progressive spasticity in the lower limbs due to pyramidal tract dysfunction. This also results in brisk reflexes, extensor plantar reflexes, muscle weakness, and variable bladder disturbances. Furthermore, among the core symptoms of HSP are also included abnormal gait and difficulty in walking, decreased vibratory sense at the ankles, and paresthesia.
Individuals with HSP can experience extreme fatigue associated with central nervous system and neuromuscular disorders, which can be disabling. Initial symptoms are typically difficulty with balance, stubbing the toe or stumbling. Symptoms of HSP may begin at any age, from infancy to older than 60 years. If symptoms begin during the teenage years or later, then spastic gait disturbance usually progresses over many years. Canes, walkers, and wheelchairs may eventually be required, although some people never require assistance devices. Disability has been described as progressing more rapidly in adult onset forms.More specifically, patients with the autosomal dominant pure form of HSP reveal normal facial and extraocular movement. Although jaw jerk may be brisk in older subjects, there is no speech disturbance or difficulty of swallowing. Upper extremity muscle tone and strength are normal. In the lower extremities, muscle tone is increased at the hamstrings, quadriceps and ankles. Weakness is most notable at the iliopsoas, tibialis anterior, and to a lesser extent, hamstring muscles.
In the complex form of the disorder, additional symptoms are present. These include: peripheral neuropathy, amyotrophy, ataxia, intellectual disability, ichthyosis, epilepsy, optic neuropathy, dementia, deafness, or problems with speech, swallowing or breathing.Anita Harding classified the HSP in a pure and complicated form. Pure HSP presents with spasticity in the lower limbs, associated with neurogenic bladder disturbance as well as lack of vibration sensitivity (pallhypesthesia). On the other hand, HSP is classified as complex when lower limb spasticity is combined with any additional neurological symptom.
This classification is subjective and patients with complex HSPs are sometimes diagnosed as having cerebellar ataxia with spasticity, mental retardation (with spasticity), or  leukodystrophy. Some of the genes listed below have been described in other diseases than HSP before. Therefore, some key genes overlap with other disease groups.","['HP:0000126', 'HP:0000252', 'HP:0000286', 'HP:0000316', 'HP:0000369', 'HP:0000448', 'HP:0000494', 'HP:0000709', 'HP:0000712', 'HP:0000738', 'HP:0000739', 'HP:0000750', 'HP:0000924', 'HP:0001155', 'HP:0001156', 'HP:0001172', 'HP:0001256', 'HP:0001257', 'HP:0001258', 'HP:0001260', 'HP:0001263', 'HP:0001270', 'HP:0001272', 'HP:0001290', 'HP:0001310', 'HP:0001317', 'HP:0001328', 'HP:0001347', 'HP:0001350', 'HP:0001371', 'HP:0001382', 'HP:0001510', 'HP:0001609', 'HP:0001760', 'HP:0001761', 'HP:0001765', 'HP:0001773', 'HP:0002015', 'HP:0002019', 'HP:0002061', 'HP:0002064', 'HP:0002307', 'HP:0002313', 'HP:0002355', 'HP:0002360', 'HP:0002464', 'HP:0002495', 'HP:0002751', 'HP:0002857', 'HP:0003202', 'HP:0003484', 'HP:0003487', 'HP:0003693', 'HP:0004322', 'HP:0005288', 'HP:0005639', 'HP:0005922', 'HP:0006986', 'HP:0007340', 'HP:0011094', 'HP:0011098', 'HP:0011448', 'HP:0011449', 'HP:0012371', 'HP:0012385', 'HP:0012443', 'HP:0025269', 'HP:0030084', 'HP:0100518', 'HP:0100543']"

192430,Velocardiofacial syndrome,"The features of this syndrome vary widely, even among members of the same family, and affect many parts of the body. Characteristic signs and symptoms may include birth defects such as congenital heart disease, defects in the palate, most commonly related to neuromuscular problems with closure (velopharyngeal insufficiency), learning disabilities, mild differences in facial features, and recurrent infections.  Infections are common in children due to problems with the immune system's T cell-mediated response that in some patients is due to an absent or hypoplastic thymus. DiGeorge syndrome may be first spotted when an affected newborn has heart defects or convulsions from hypocalcemia due to malfunctioning parathyroid glands and low levels of parathyroid hormone (parathormone).
Affected individuals may also have other kinds of birth defects including kidney abnormalities and significant feeding difficulties as babies. Gastrointestinal issues are also very
common in this patient population. Digestive motility issues may result in constipation. Disorders such as hypothyroidism and hypoparathyroidism or thrombocytopenia (low platelet levels), and psychiatric illnesses are common late-occurring features.Microdeletions in chromosomal region 22q11.2 are associated with a 20 to 30-fold increased risk of schizophrenia. Studies provide various rates of 22q11.2DS in schizophrenia, ranging from 0.5 to 2.0% and averaging about 1.0%, compared with the overall estimated 0.025% risk of the 22q11.2DS in the general population.Salient features can be summarized using the mnemonic CATCH-22 to describe 22q11.2DS, with the 22 signifying the chromosomal abnormality is found on the 22nd chromosome, as below:
Cardiac abnormality (commonly interrupted aortic arch, truncus arteriosus and tetralogy of Fallot)
Abnormal facies
Thymic aplasia
Cleft palate
Hypocalcemia/hypoparathyroidismIndividuals can have many possible features, ranging in number of associated features and from the mild to the very serious. Symptoms shown to be common include:

Other features may include loose skin, thin deep-set nails, thin hair, short ribs, limited elbow and knee extension, camptodactyly, and a coarse, low-pitched voice. Delayed development of motor skills such as sitting, standing, and walking are commonly exhibited in early childhood.

The first signs are usually petechiae and bruising, resulting from a low platelet count (i.e. thrombocytopenia). Spontaneous nose bleeds and bloody diarrhea are also common and eczema typically develops within the first month of life. Recurrent bacterial infections develop by three months. The majority of children with WAS develop at least one autoimmune disorder, and cancers (mainly lymphoma and leukemia) develop in up to a third of patients. Immunoglobulin M (IgM) levels are reduced, IgA and IgE are elevated, and IgG levels can be normal, reduced, or elevated. In addition to thrombocytopenia, WAS patients have abnormally small platelets (i.e. microthrombocytes) and ~30% also have elevated eosinophil  counts (i.e. eosinophilia).","['HP:0000112', 'HP:0000140', 'HP:0000225', 'HP:0000246', 'HP:0000388', 'HP:0000389', 'HP:0000421', 'HP:0000491', 'HP:0000498', 'HP:0000509', 'HP:0000778', 'HP:0000964', 'HP:0000967', 'HP:0000978', 'HP:0000979', 'HP:0001025', 'HP:0001287', 'HP:0001328', 'HP:0001369', 'HP:0001645', 'HP:0001873', 'HP:0001875', 'HP:0001878', 'HP:0001879', 'HP:0001888', 'HP:0001891', 'HP:0001903', 'HP:0001935', 'HP:0001945', 'HP:0001983', 'HP:0002014', 'HP:0002028', 'HP:0002037', 'HP:0002090', 'HP:0002094', 'HP:0002170', 'HP:0002205', 'HP:0002248', 'HP:0002249', 'HP:0002488', 'HP:0002573', 'HP:0002633', 'HP:0002664', 'HP:0002665', 'HP:0002721', 'HP:0002783', 'HP:0002788', 'HP:0002848', 'HP:0002850', 'HP:0002960', 'HP:0002963', 'HP:0002971', 'HP:0003010', 'HP:0003212', 'HP:0003261', 'HP:0005310', 'HP:0005537', 'HP:0005558', 'HP:0006510', 'HP:0006535', 'HP:0007420', 'HP:0009830', 'HP:0011029', 'HP:0011675', 'HP:0011869', 'HP:0011875', 'HP:0011944', 'HP:0012378', 'HP:0040184', 'HP:0100749', 'HP:0100774', 'HP:0100806', 'HP:0100820', 'HP:0200042']"

Fewer elastic fibers are present in the papillary dermis and fragmented elastic fibers in the reticular dermis are observed. Epidermal samples from the same patient subjected to electron microscopy revealed that elastin fibers display abnormally high levels of fragmentation and clumping of microfibrils, with little amorphous elastin. Within collagen bundles, collagen fibrils are of irregular shape and thickness. These disruptions of the patient’s connective tissue play a role in the inelasticity of the skin and wrinkling.","['HP:0000023', 'HP:0000028', 'HP:0000218', 'HP:0000252', 'HP:0000253', 'HP:0000260', 'HP:0000270', 'HP:0000286', 'HP:0000316', 'HP:0000319', 'HP:0000343', 'HP:0000369', 'HP:0000431', 'HP:0000455', 'HP:0000494', 'HP:0000670', 'HP:0000684', 'HP:0000691', 'HP:0000750', 'HP:0000767', 'HP:0000938', 'HP:0000973', 'HP:0001249', 'HP:0001252', 'HP:0001263', 'HP:0001305', 'HP:0001320', 'HP:0001350', 'HP:0001374', 'HP:0001382', 'HP:0001476', 'HP:0001508', 'HP:0001511', 'HP:0001537', 'HP:0001611', 'HP:0001762', 'HP:0001763', 'HP:0001788', 'HP:0001799', 'HP:0001808', 'HP:0001869', 'HP:0002073', 'HP:0002097', 'HP:0002133', 'HP:0002645', 'HP:0002650', 'HP:0002751', 'HP:0002761', 'HP:0002808', 'HP:0002812', 'HP:0003100', 'HP:0003160', 'HP:0003199', 'HP:0003691', 'HP:0004322', 'HP:0004426', 'HP:0004993', 'HP:0005272', 'HP:0005425', 'HP:0006114', 'HP:0006191', 'HP:0006891', 'HP:0007392', 'HP:0007407', 'HP:0007414', 'HP:0007457', 'HP:0007517', 'HP:0008070', 'HP:0008113', 'HP:0008897', 'HP:0008947', 'HP:0009004', 'HP:0009125', 'HP:0010838', 'HP:0010989', 'HP:0011003', 'HP:0011995', 'HP:0025167', 'HP:0200141']"

214100,Zellweger syndrome,"Zellweger syndrome is one of three peroxisome biogenesis disorders which belong to the Zellweger spectrum of peroxisome biogenesis disorders (PBD-ZSD). The other two disorders are neonatal adrenoleukodystrophy (NALD), and infantile Refsum disease (IRD). Although all have a similar molecular basis for disease, Zellweger syndrome is the most severe of these three disorders.Zellweger syndrome is associated with impaired neuronal migration, neuronal positioning, and brain development. In addition, individuals with Zellweger syndrome can show a reduction in central nervous system (CNS) myelin (particularly cerebral), which is referred to as hypomyelination. Myelin is critical for normal CNS functions, and in this regard, serves to insulate nerve fibers in the brain. Patients can also show postdevelopmental sensorineuronal degeneration that leads to a progressive loss of hearing and vision.Zellweger syndrome can also affect the function of many other organ systems. Patients can show craniofacial abnormalities (such as a high forehead, hypoplastic supraorbital ridges, epicanthal folds, midface hypoplasia, and a large fontanel), hepatomegaly (enlarged liver), chondrodysplasia punctata (punctate calcification of the cartilage in specific regions of the body), eye abnormalities, and renal cysts. Newborns may present with profound hypotonia (low muscle tone), seizures, apnea, and an inability to eat.","['HP:0000028', 'HP:0000047', 'HP:0000126', 'HP:0000158', 'HP:0000218', 'HP:0000244', 'HP:0000256', 'HP:0000272', 'HP:0000286', 'HP:0000311', 'HP:0000316', 'HP:0000347', 'HP:0000348', 'HP:0000358', 'HP:0000407', 'HP:0000463', 'HP:0000501', 'HP:0000512', 'HP:0000518', 'HP:0000543', 'HP:0000580', 'HP:0000582', 'HP:0000639', 'HP:0000835', 'HP:0000954', 'HP:0001088', 'HP:0001193', 'HP:0001250', 'HP:0001252', 'HP:0001265', 'HP:0001284', 'HP:0001290', 'HP:0001401', 'HP:0001508', 'HP:0001591', 'HP:0001623', 'HP:0001629', 'HP:0001643', 'HP:0001762', 'HP:0001838', 'HP:0001840', 'HP:0002089', 'HP:0002126', 'HP:0002240', 'HP:0002282', 'HP:0002416', 'HP:0002705', 'HP:0002750', 'HP:0002967', 'HP:0003355', 'HP:0003455', 'HP:0004492', 'HP:0004734', 'HP:0005469', 'HP:0005989', 'HP:0006579', 'HP:0006887', 'HP:0006894', 'HP:0007370', 'HP:0007759', 'HP:0008665', 'HP:0009487', 'HP:0010655', 'HP:0010808', 'HP:0010864', 'HP:0011039', 'HP:0012368', 'HP:0012592']"
